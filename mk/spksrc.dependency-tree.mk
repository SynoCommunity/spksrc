### generate text output of package dependencies
### dependency-tree:
### - print a tree of the package dependencies
### dependency-list:
### - print a list of the package dependencies
###   single line output starts with $(NAME): follwed by a list of all dependencies.
###   the dependencies include the folder (cross or native).
###   the list is sorted and does not include duplicate dependencies.
###   sample:
###   minio: cross/busybox cross/minio native/go native/go-1.4
### 
### NOTES:
### o Packages with conditional dependencies must define such dependencies 
###   additionally with OPTIONAL_DEPENDS, otherwise not all dependencies are found.
### 
### o dependency-tree and dependency-list call make for all dependencies without 
###   the definition of specific ARCH nor TCVERSION.
###   Therefore every Makefile (including mk/*.mk) must not abort nor put 
###   output with error, warning or info directive when the variable 
###   DEPENDENCY_WALK is set to 1.
