    #       deleted the security database and is re-installing the package
    #       to fix it. Then:
    #       o We either use the password from SYSDBA.password file (if it exists)
    #       o Or generate new random password and announce it in the log.
    # - Upgrades where security.db exists are best because we don't do anything.
