DESCRIPTION = "Jackett works as a proxy server. It translates queries from apps into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting software. Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping and translation logic - removing the burden from other apps."
CHANGELOG = "1. Update Jackett to 0.20.3990.<br/>2. Fix dotnet dependencies for DSM 7.2."
