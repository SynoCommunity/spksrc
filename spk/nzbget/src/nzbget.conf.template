# Sample configuration file for NZBGet
#
# On POSIX put this file to one of the following locations:
# ~/.nzbget
# /etc/nzbget.conf
# /usr/etc/nzbget.conf
# /usr/local/etc/nzbget.conf
# /opt/etc/nzbget.conf
#
# On Windows put this file in program's directory.
#
# You can also put the file into any location, if you specify the path to it
# using switch "-c", e.g:
#   nzbget -c /home/user/myconfig.txt

# For quick start change the option MainDir and configure one news-server

# Filter rules for items.
#
# Use filter to ignore unwanted items in the feed. In its simplest version
# the filter is a space separated list of words which must be present in
# the item title.
#
# Example: linux debian dvd.
#
# MORE INFO:
# NOTE: This is a short documentation, for more information visit
# http://nzbget.net/RSS.
#
# Feed filter consists of rules - one rule per line. Each rule defines
# a search string and a command, which must be performed if the search
# string matches. There are five kinds of rule-commands: Accept,
# Reject, Require, Options, Comment.
#
# NOTE: Since options in the configuration file can not span multiple
# lines, the lines (rules) must be separated with %-character (percent).
#
# Definition of a rule:
#  [A:|A(options):|R:|Q:|O(options):|#] search-string
#
#  A - declares Accept-rule. Rules are accept-rules by default, the
#      "A:" can be imitted. If the feed item matches to the rule the
#      item is considered good and no further rules are checked.
#  R - declares Reject-rule. If the feed item matches to the rule the
#      item is considered bad and no further rules are checked.
#  Q - declares Require-rule. If the feed item DOES NOT match to the rule
#      the item is considered bad and no further rules are checked.
#  O - declares Options-rule. If the feed item matches to the rule the
#      options declared in the rule are set for the item. The item is
#      neither accepted nor rejected via this rule but can be accepted
#      later by one of Accept-rules. In this case the item will have its
#      options already set (unless the Accept-rule overrides them).
#  # - lines starting with # are considered comments and are ignored. You
#      can use comments to explain complex rules or to temporary disable
#      rules for debugging.
#
# Options allow to set properties on nzb-file. It's a comma-separated
# list of property names with their values.
#
# Definition of an option:
#  name:value
#
# Options can be defined using long option names or short names:
#  category (cat, c)    - set category name, value is a string;
#  pause (p)            - add nzb in paused or unpaused state, possible
#                         values are: yes (y), no (n);
#  priority (pr, r)     - set priority, value is a signed integer number;
#  priority+ (pr+, r+)  - increase priority, value is a signed integer number;
#  dupescore (ds, s)    - set duplicate score, value is a signed integer number;
#  dupescore+ (ds+, s+) - increase duplicate score, value is a signed integer number;
#  dupekey (dk, k)      - set duplicate key, value is a string;
#  dupekey+ (dk+, k+)   - add to duplicate key, value is a string;
#  dupemode (dm, m)     - set duplicate check mode, possible values
#                         are: score (s), all (a), force (f);
#  rageid				- generate duplicate key using this rageid
#                         (integer number) and season/episode numbers;
#  series				- generate duplicate key using series identifier
#                         (any unique string) and season/episode numbers.
#
# Examples of option definitions:
#  Accept(category:my series, pause:yes, priority:100): my show 1080p;
#  Options(c:my series, p:y, r:100): 1080p;
#  Options(s:1000): 1080p;
#  Options(k+:1080p): 1080p;
#  Options(dupemode:force): BluRay.
#
# Rule-options override values set in feed-options.
#
# The search-string is similar to used in search engines. It consists of
# search terms separated with spaces. Every term is checked for a feed
# item and if they all succeed the rule is considered matching.
#
# Definition of a term:
#  [+|-][field:][command]param
#
#  +       - declares a positive term. Terms are positive by default,
#            the "+" can be omitted;
#  -       - declares a negative term. If the term succeed the feed
#            item is ignored;
#  field   - field to which apply the term. If not specified
#            the default field "title" is used;
#  command - a special character defining how to interpret the
#            parameter (followed after the command):
#            @  - search for string "param". This is default command,
#                 the "@" can be omitted;
#            $  - "param" defines a regular expression (using POSIX Extended
#                 Regular Expressions syntax);
#            =  - equal;
#            <  - less than;
#            <= - equal or less than;
#            >  - greater than;
#            >= - equal or greater than;
#  param   - parameter for command.
#
# Commands @ and $ are for use with text fields (title, filename, category,
# link, description, dupekey). Commands =, <, <=, > and >= are for use
# with numeric fields (size, age, imdbid, rageid, season, episode, priority,
# dupescore).
#
# Only fields title, filename and age are always present. The availability of
# other fields depend on rss feed provider.
#
# Any newznab attribute (encoded as "newznab:attr" in the RSS feed) can
# be used as search field with prefix "attr-", for example "attr-genre".
#
# Text search (Command @) supports supports wildcard characters * (matches
# any number of any characters), ? (matches any one character)
# and # (matches one digit).
# Text search is by default performed against words (word-search mode): the
# field content is separated into words and then each word is checked
# against pattern. If the search pattern starts and ends with * (star)
# the search is performed against the whole field content
# (substring-search mode). If the search pattern contains word separator
# characters (except * and ?) the search is performed on the whole
# field (the word-search would be obviously never successful in this
# case). Word separators are: !\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~.
#
# Field "size" can have suffixes "K" or "KB" for kilobytes, "M" or "MB"
# for megabytes and "G" or "GB" for gigabytes. Field "age" can have
# suffixes "m" for minutes, "h" for hours and "d" for days. If suffix
# is not specified default is days.
#
# Examples (the trailing ; or . is not part of filter):
# 1) A: s01* -category:anime;
# 2) my show WEB-DL;
# 3) *my?show* WEB-DL size:<1.8GB age:>2h;
# 4) R: size:>9GB;
# 5) Q: HDTV.

#
# NOTE: nzb-files are processed by scan and queue scripts. See
# options <ScanScript> and <QueueScript>.
NzbDirInterval=5

# How old nzb-file should at least be for it to be loaded to queue (seconds).
#
# NZBGet checks if nzb-file was not modified in last few seconds, defined by
# this option. That safety interval prevents the loading of files, which
# were not yet completely saved to disk, for example if they are still being
# downloaded in web-browser.
NzbDirFileAge=60

# Check for duplicate titles (yes, no).
#
# If this option is enabled the program checks by adding of a new nzb-file:
# 1) if history contains the same title (see below) with success status
#    the nzb-file is not added to queue;
# 2) if download queue already contains the same title the nzb-file is
#    added to queue for backup (if firt file fails);
# 3) if nzb-file contains duplicate entries. This helps to find errors
#    in bad nzb-files.
#
# "Same title" means the nzb file name is same or the duplicate key is
# same. Duplicate keys are set by fetching from RSS feeds using title
# identifier fields provided by RSS provider (imdbid or rageid/season/episode).
#
# If duplicates were detected only one of them is downloaded. If download
# fails another duplicate is tried. If download succeeds all remaining
# duplicates are deleted from queue.
#
# NOTE: For automatic duplicate handling option <HealthCheck> must be
# set to "Delete" or "None". If it is set to "Pause" you will need to
# manually unpause another duplicate (if any exists in queue).
#
# NOTE: For more info on duplicates see http://nzbget.net/RSS.

### DOWNLOAD QUEUE                                                         ###

# Save download queue to disk (yes, no).
#
# This allows to reload it on next start.
SaveQueue=yes

# Flush download queue to disk (yes, no).
#
# Immediately flush file buffers for queue state file. This improves
# safety for the queue file but may decrease disk performance due to
# disabling of disk caching for queue state file.
#
# You can disable this option if it negatively affects disk performance on your
# system. You should create backups of queue-directory (option <QueueDir>)
# in that case. Keep the option enabled if your system often crashes.
FlushQueue=yes

# Reload download queue on start, if it exists (yes, no).
ReloadQueue=yes

# Continue download of partially downloaded files (yes, no).
#
# If active the current state (the info about what articles were already
# downloaded) is saved every second and is reloaded after restart. This is
# about files included in download jobs (usually rar-files), not about
# download-jobs (nzb-files) itself. Download-jobs are always
# continued regardless of that option.
#
# Disabling this option may slighlty reduce disk access and is
# therefore recommended on fast connections.
ContinuePartial=yes

# Propagation delay to your news servers (minutes).
#
# The option sets minimum post age for nzb-files. Very recent files
# are not downloaded to avoid download failures. The files remain 
# on hold in the download queue until the propagation delay expires,
# after that they are downloaded.
PropagationDelay=0

# Decode articles (yes, no).
#
# yes - decode articles using internal decoder (supports yEnc and UU formats);
# no - articles will not be decoded/joined. Useful to look at article's source text.
#
# NOTE: This option is primary for debugging purposes. You should not
# disable it.
Decode=yes

# Memory limit for article cache (megabytes).
#
# Article cache helps to improve performance. First the amount of disk
# operations can be significantly reduced. Second the created files are
# less fragmented, which again speeds up the post-processing (unpacking).
#
# The article cache works best with option <DirectWrite> which can
# effectively use even small cache (like 50 MB).
#
# If option <DirectWrite> is disabled the cache should be big enough to
# hold all articles of one file (typically up to 200 MB, sometimes even
# 500 MB). Otherwise the articles are written into temporary directory
# when the cache is full, which degrades performance.
#
# Value "0" disables article cache.
#
# In 32 bit mode the maximum allowed value is 1900.
#
# NOTE: Also see option <WriteBuffer>.
ArticleCache=0

# Write decoded articles directly into destination output file (yes, no).
#
# Files are posted to Usenet in multiple pieces (articles). Each file
# typically consists of hundreds of articles.
#
# When option <DirectWrite> is disabled and the article cache (option
# <ArticleCache>) is not active or is full the program saves downloaded
# articles into temporary directory and later reads them all to write
# again into the destination file.
#
# When option <DirectWrite> is enabled the program at first creates the
# output destination file with required size (total size of all articles),
# then writes the articles directly to this file without creating of any
# temporary files. If article cache (option <ArticleCache>) is active
# the downloaded articles are saved into cache first and are written
# into the destination file when the cache flushes. This happen when
# all articles of the file are downloaded or when the cache becomes
# full to 90%.
#
# The direct write relies on the ability of file system to create 
# empty files without allocating the space on the drive (sparse files),
# which most modern file systems support including EXT3, EXT4
# and NTFS. The notable exception is HFS+ (default file system on OSX).
#
# The direct write usually improves performance by reducing the amount
# of disk operations but may produce more fragmented files when used
# without article cache.
DirectWrite=yes

# Memory limit for per article write buffer (kilobytes).
#
# When downloaded articles are written into disk the OS collects
# data in the internal buffer before flushing it into disk. This option
# controls the size of this buffer per connection/download thread.
#
# Larger buffers decrease the amount of disk operations and help
# producing less fragmented files speeding up the post-processing
# (unpack).
#
# To calculate the maximum memory required for all download threads multiply
# WriteBuffer by number of connections configured in section
# "NEWS-SERVERS". The option sets the limit, the actual buffer can be
# smaller if the article size (typically about 500 KB) is below the limit.
#
# Write-buffer is managed by OS (system libraries) and therefore
# the effect of the option is highly OS-dependent.
#
# Recommended value for computers with enough memory: 1024.
#
# Value "0" disables the setting of buffer size. In this case a buffer
# of default size (OS and compiler specific) is used, which is usually
# too small (1-4 KB) and therefore not optimal.
#
# NOTE: Also see option <ArticleCache>.
WriteBuffer=0

# Check CRC of downloaded and decoded articles (yes, no).
#
# Normally this option should be enabled for better detecting of download
# errors. However checking of CRC needs CPU time. On a fast connection and
# slow CPU disabling of CRC-Check may improve performance.
CrcCheck=yes

# How many retries should be attempted if a download error occurs (0-99).
#
# If download fails because of incomplete or damaged article or due to
# CRC-error the program tries to redownload the article from the same
# news server as many times as defined in option <Retries>. If all
# attempts fail the program tries another news server.
#
# If download fails because of "article or group not found error" the
# program tries another news server without retrying on the failed server.
#
# If download fails because of interrupted connection the program
# tries another news server or the same server after the block interval
# expires.
Retries=3

# Wait interval between retries (seconds).
#
# If download of an article fails because of interrupted connection
# the server is temporary blocked until the retry interval expires.
RetryInterval=10

# Connection timeout for article downloading (seconds).
ArticleTimeout=60

# Connection timeout for URL fetching (seconds).
#
# This includes fetching of nzb-files via URLs and fetching of RSS feeds.
UrlTimeout=60

# Timeout until a download-thread should be killed (seconds).
#
# This can help on hanging downloads, but is dangerous.
# Do not use small values!
TerminateTimeout=600

# Set the maximum download rate on program start (kilobytes/sec).
#
# The download rate can be changed later via remote calls.
#
# Value "0" means no speed control.
DownloadRate=0

# Accurate speed rate calculation (yes, no).
#
# During downloading using several connections the download threads may
# interfere with each other when updating statistical data for speed
# meter. This may cause small errors in current download speed reported
# by the program. The speed meter recovers automatically from such errors
# after max. 30 seconds (time window used for speed calculation).
#
# Enable the option to use thread synchronisation mechanisms in order to
# provide absolutely accurate speed calculations.
#
# NOTE: Thread synchronisation increases CPU load and therefore can
# decrease download speed. Do not activate this option on computers with
# limited CPU power. Before activating the option it is recommended to
# run tests to determine how the option affects the CPU usage and the
# download speed on a particular system.
AccurateRate=no

# Pause if disk space gets below this value (megabytes).
#
# Disk space is checked for directories pointed by option <DestDir> and
# option <InterDir>.
#
# Value "0" disables the check.
DiskSpace=250

# Delete already downloaded files from disk when nzb-file is deleted
# (yes, no).
#
# This option defines if downloaded files must be deleted when:
# 1) download of nzb-file is cancelled (deleted from queue);
# 2) history record with failure-status (par-failure or unpack-failure)
# is deleted from history.
DeleteCleanupDisk=yes

# Delete source nzb-file when it is not needed anymore (yes, no).
#
# Enable this option for automatic deletion of source nzb-file from
# incoming directory when the program doesn't require it anymore (the
# nzb-file has been deleted from queue and history).
NzbCleanupDisk=yes

# Keep the history of downloaded nzb-files (days).
#
# After download and post-processing the items are added to history where
# their status can be checked and they can be post-processed again if
# neccessary.
#
# After expiring of defined period:
#
# If option <DupeCheck> is active the items become hidden and the amount
# of data kept is significantly reduced (for better performance), only
# fields necessary for duplicate check are kept. The item remain in the
# hidden history (forever);
#
# If option <DupeCheck> is NOT active the items are removed from history.
#
# Value "0" disables history. Duplicate check will not work.
KeepHistory=30

# Keep the history of outdated feed items (days).
#
# After fetching of an RSS feed the information about included items (nzb-files)
# is saved to disk. This allows to detect new items on next fetch. Feed 
# providers update RSS feeds constantly. Since the feed length is limited
# (usually 100 items or less) the old items get pushed away by new
# ones. When an item is not present in the feed anymore it's not necessary
# to keep the information about this item on the disk.
#
# If option is set to "0", the outdated items are deleted from history
# immediately.
#
# Otherwise the items are held in the history for defined number of
# days. Keeping of items for few days helps in situations when feed provider
# has technical issues and may response with empty feeds (or with missing
# items). When the technical issue is fixed the items may reappear in the
# feed causing the program to redownload items if they were not found in
# the feed history. 
FeedHistory=7

# Maximum number of simultaneous connections for nzb URL downloads (0-999).
#
# When NZB-files are added to queue via URL, the program downloads them
# from the specified URL. The option limits the maximal number of connections
# used for this purpose, when multiple URLs were added at the same time.
UrlConnections=4

# Force URL-downloads even if download queue is paused (yes, no).
#
# If option is active the URL-downloads (such as appending of nzb-files
# via URL or fetching of RSS feeds and nzb-files from feeds) are performed
# even if download is in paused state.

### PAR CHECK/REPAIR                                                       ###

# Whether and how par-verification must be performed (auto, always, force, manual).
#
#  Auto   - par-check is performed when needed. One par2-file is always
#           downloaded. Additional par2-files are downloaded if needed
#           for repair. Repair is performed if the option <ParRepair>
#           is enabled;
#  Always - check every download (even undamaged). One par2-file is
#           always downloaded. Additional par2-files are downloaded
#           if needed for repair.  Repair is performed if the option 
#           <ParRepair> is enabled;
#  Force  - force par-check for every download (even undamaged). All
#           par2-files are always downloaded. Repair is performed if
#           the option <ParRepair> is enabled;
#  Manual - par-check is skipped. One par2-file is always
#           downloaded. If a damaged download is detected, all
#           par2-files are downloaded but neithet par-check nor par-repair
#           take place. The download can be then repaired manually,
#           eventually on another faster computer.
ParCheck=auto

# Check for renamed and missing files (yes, no).
#
# Par-rename restores original file names using information stored
# in par2-files. It also detects missing files (files listed in
# par2-files but not present on disk). When enabled the par-rename is
# performed as the first step of post-processing for every nzb-file.
#
# Par-rename is very fast and is highly recommended, especially if
# unpack is disabled.
ParRename=yes

# Automatic par-repair after par-verification (yes, no).
#
# If option <ParCheck> is set to "Auto" or "Force" this option defines
# if the download must be repaired when needed. The option can be
# disabled if computer does not have enough CPU power, since repairing
# may take too much resources and time on a slow computers.
ParRepair=yes

# What files should be scanned during par-verification (limited, extended,
# full, dupe).
#
#  Limited  - scan only files belonging to par-set;
#  Extended - scan files belonging to par-set first, scan other files until
#             all missing files are found;
#  Full     - scan all files in destination directory. Can be very time
#             consuming but may sometimes repair where Limited and Extended fail;
#  Dupe     - scan files belonging to par-set first, scan other files until
#             repair is possible. Even files from other duplicate-downloads
#             are scanned. Can be very time consuming but brings best results.
ParScan=extended

# Quick file verification during par-check (yes, no).
#
# If the option is active the files are quickly verified using
# checksums calculated during download; quick verification is very fast 
# because it doesn't require the reading of files from disk, NZBGet 
# knows checksums of downloaded files and quickly compares them with 
# checksums stored in the par-file.
#
# If the option is disabled the files are verified as usual. That's
# slow. Use this if the quick verification doesn't work properly.
ParQuick=yes

# Memory limit for par-repair buffer (megabytes).
#
# Set the amount of RAM that the par-checker may use during repair. Having
# the buffer as big as the total size of all damaged blocks allows for
# the optimal repair speed. The option sets the maximum buffer size, the
# allocated buffer can be smaller.
#
# If you have a lot of RAM set the option to few hundreds (MB) for the
# best repair performance.
ParBuffer=16

# Number of threads to use during par-repair (0-99).
#
# On multi-core CPUs for the best speed set the option to the number of
# logical cores (physical cores + hyper-threading units). If you want
# to utilize the CPU to 100% you may need to add one or two additional threads
# to compensate for wait intervals used for thread synchronization.
#
# On single-core CPUs use only one thread.
#
# Set to '0' to automatically use all available CPU cores (may not
# work on old or exotic platforms).
ParThreads=0

# Files to ignore during par-check.
#
# List of file extensions, file names or file masks to ignore by
# par-rename and par-check. The entries must be separated with
# commas.
#
# The entries must be separated with commas. The entries can be file
# extensions, file names or file masks containing wildcard
# characters * and ?.
#
# If par-rename or par-check detect missing or damaged files they
# will ignore files matching this option and will not initiate
# repair. This avoids time costing repair for unimportant files.
#
# NOTE: Files matching the option <ExtCleanupDisk> are ignored as well.
#
# Example: .sfv, .nzb, .nfo
ParIgnoreExt=.sfv, .nzb, .nfo

# What to do if download health drops below critical health (delete,
# pause, none).
#
#  Delete - delete nzb-file from queue. If option <DeleteCleanupDisk>
#           is active the already downloaded files will be deleted too;
#  Pause  - pause nzb-file;
#  None   - do nothing (continue download).
#
# NOTE: For automatic duplicate handling option must be set to "Delete"
# or "None". If it is set to "Pause" you will need to manually return
# another duplicate to queue (if any exists in history). See also
# option <DupeCheck>.
#
# NOTE: When option <ParScan> is set to "Dupe" the delete-action is performed
# only if article completion is below 10% (empirical threshold). This is to
# improve efficiency of dupe par scan mode.
HealthCheck=delete

# Maximum allowed time for par-repair (minutes).
#
# If you use NZBGet on a very slow computer like NAS-device, it may be good to
# limit the time allowed for par-repair. NZBGet calculates the estimated time
# required for par-repair. If the estimated value exceeds the limit defined
# here, NZBGet cancels the repair.
#
# To avoid a false cancellation NZBGet compares the estimated time with
# <ParTimeLimit> after the first 5 minutes of repairing, when the calculated
# estimated time is more or less accurate. But in a case if <ParTimeLimit> is
# set to a value smaller than 5 minutes, the comparison is made after the first
# whole minute.
#
# Value "0" means unlimited.
#
# NOTE: The option limits only the time required for repairing. It doesn't
# affect the first stage of parcheck - verification of files. However the
# verification speed is constant, it doesn't depend on files integrity and
# therefore it is not necessary to limit the time needed for the first stage.
ParTimeLimit=0

# Pause download queue during check/repair (yes, no).
#
# Enable the option to give CPU more time for par-check/repair. That helps
# to speed up check/repair on slow CPUs with fast connection (e.g. NAS-devices).
#
# NOTE: If parchecker needs additional par-files it temporarily unpauses
# the queue.
#
# NOTE: See also options <ScriptPauseQueue> and <UnpackPauseQueue>.
ParPauseQueue=no

# Cleanup download queue after successful check/repair (yes, no).
#
# Enable this option for automatic deletion of unneeded (paused) par-files
# from download queue after successful check/repair.

# Unpack downloaded nzb-files (yes, no).
#
# Each download (nzb-file) has a post-processing parameter "Unpack". The option
# <Unpack> is the default value assigned to this pp-parameter of the download
# when it is added to queue.
#
# When nzb-file is added to queue it can have a category assigned to it. In this
# case the option <CategoryX.Unpack> overrides the global option <Unpack>.
#
# If the download is damaged and could not be repaired using par-files
# the unpacking is not performed.
#
# If the option <ParCheck> is set to "Auto" the program tries to unpack
# downloaded files first. If the unpacking fails the par-check/repair
# is performed and the unpack is executed again.
Unpack=yes

# Pause download queue during unpack (yes, no).
#
# Enable the option to give CPU more time for unpacking. That helps
# to speed up unpacking on slow CPUs.
#
# NOTE: See also options <ParPauseQueue> and <ScriptPauseQueue>.
UnpackPauseQueue=no

# Delete archive files after successful unpacking (yes, no).
UnpackCleanupDisk=yes

# Full path to unrar executable.
#
# Example: /usr/bin/unrar.
#
# The option can also contain extra switches to pass to unrar. To the 
# here defined command line NZBGet adds the following switches:
#    x -y -p- -o+ *.rar ./_unpack/
#
# Switch "x" is added only if neither "x" nor "e" were defined in
# the option (this allows you to use switch "e" instead of "x"). switch
# "-o+" is added only if neither "-o+" nor "-o-" were defined
# in the command line. All other paramaters are always added. Parameter
# "-p-" is replaced with "-ppassword" if a password is set for nzb-file.
#
# Examples:
# 1) ignore file attributes (pemissions):
# /usr/bin/unrar x -ai;
# 2) decrease priority of unrar-process:
# nice -n 19 unrar.
#
# For other useful switches refer to unrar documentation.
#
# If unrar is in your PATH you may leave the path part and set only
# the executable name ("unrar" on POSIX or "unrar.exe" on Windows).
UnrarCmd=unrar

# Full path to 7-Zip executable.
#
# Example: /usr/bin/7z.
#
# Similar to option <UnrarCmd> this option can also include extra switches.
#
# If 7-Zip binary is in your PATH you may leave the path part and set only
# the executable name ("7z" or "7za" on POSIX or "7z.exe" on Windows).
SevenZipCmd=7z

# Files to delete after successful download.
#
# List of file extensions, file names or file masks to delete after
# successful download. If either unpack or par-check fail the cleanup is
# not performed. If neither unpack nor par-check were made (because they
# were disabled or the download doesn't contain archives and/or par-files
# the cleanup is performed if the health is 100%.
#
# The entries must be separated with commas. The entries can be file
# extensions, file names or file masks containing wildcard
# characters * and ?.
#
# Files listed here are also ignored by par-rename and par-check.
#
# NOTE: See also option <ParIgnoreExt>.
#
# Example: .par2, .sfv
ExtCleanupDisk=.par2, .sfv, _brokenlog.txt

# Path to file containing unpack passwords.
#
# If the option is set the program will try all passwords from the file
# when unpacking the archives. The file must be a text file containing
# one password per line.
#
# If an nzb-file has a defined password (in the post-processing settings)
# then the password-file is not used for that nzb-file.
#
# NOTE: Trying multiple passwords is a time consuming task. Whenever possible
# passwords should be set per nzb-file in their post-processing settings.

### EXTENSION SCRIPTS                                                      ###

# Default list of post-processing scripts to execute after the download
# of nzb-file is completed and possibly par-checked/repaired and unpacked.
#
# The scripts in the list must be separated with commas or semicolons. Only
# filenames without path must be used. All scripts must be stored in directory
# pointed by option <ScriptDir>. 
#
# Example: Cleanup.sh, Move.sh, EMail.py.
#
# Each download (nzb-file) has its own list of post-processing scripts. The option
# <PostScript> is the default value assigned to download when it is added to
# queue. The list of post-processing scripts for a particular download can be
# changed in the edit dialog in web-interface or using remote command "--edit/-E".
#
# When nzb-file is added to queue it can have a category assigned to it. In this
# case the option <CategoryX.PostScript> (if not empty) overrides the
# global option <PostScript>.
#
# NOTE: The script execution order is controlled by option <ScriptOrder>, not
# by their order in option <PostScript>.
#
# NOTE: Changing options <PostScript> and <CategoryX.PostScript> doesn't affect
# already queued downloads.
#
# NOTE: For the list of interesting post-processing scripts see
# http://nzbget.net/Catalog_of_post-processing_scripts.
#
# INFO FOR DEVELOPERS:
# NOTE: This is a short documentation, for more information visit
# http://nzbget.net/Extension_scripts.
#
# NZBGet passes following arguments to post-processing script as environment
# variables:
#  NZBPP_DIRECTORY    - path to destination dir for downloaded files;
#  NZBPP_NZBNAME      - user-friendly name of processed nzb-file as it is displayed
#                       by the program. The file path and extension are removed.
#                       If download was renamed, this parameter reflects the new name;
#  NZBPP_NZBFILENAME  - name of processed nzb-file. It includes file extension and also
#                       may include full path;
#  NZBPP_FINALDIR     - final destination path if set by one of previous pp-scripts;
#  NZBPP_CATEGORY     - category assigned to nzb-file (can be empty string);
#  NZBPP_DUPEKEY      - duplicate key of nzb-file;
#  NZBPP_DUPESCORE    - duplicate score of nzb-file;
#  NZBPP_DUPEMODE     - duplicate mode of nzb-file: SCORE, ALL, FORCE;
#  NZBPP_TOTALSTATUS  - total status of nzb-file:
#                       SUCCESS - everything OK;
#                       WARNING - download is damaged but probably can
#                                 be repaired; user intervention is
#                                 required;
#                       FAILURE - download has failed or a serious error
#                                 occurred during post-processing (unpack, par);
#                       DELETED - download was deleted; post-processing
#                                 scripts are usually not called in this case;
#                                 however it's possible to force calling
#                                 scripts with command "post-process again";
#  NZBPP_STATUS       - complete status info for nzb-file: it consists
#                       of total status and status detail separated with
#                       slash, for example: "FAILURE/UNPACK"; for possible
#                       status details see documentation on web site;
#  NZBPP_SCRIPTSTATUS - summary status of the scripts executed before the
#                       current one:
#                       NONE - no other scripts were executed yet or all
#                              of them have ended with exit code "NONE";
#                       SUCCESS - all other scripts have ended with exit
#                                 code "SUCCESS" ;
#                       FAILURE - at least one of the script has failed;
#  NZBPP_HEALTH       - download health: an integer value in the range
#                       from 0 (all articles failed) to 1000 (all articles
#                       successfully downloaded);
#  NZBPP_CRITICALHEALTH - critical health for this nzb-file: an integer 
#                       value in the range 0-1000. The critical health 
#                       is calculated based on number and size of
#                       par-files. If nzb-file doesn't have any par-files
#                       the critical health is 1000 (100.0%). If a half
#                       of nzb-file were par-files its critical health
#                       would be 0. If NZBPP_HEALTH goes down below
#                       NZBPP_CRITICALHEALTH the download becomes unrepairable;
#  NZBPP_TOTALARTICLES - number of articles in nzb-file;
#  NZBPP_SUCCESSARTICLES - number of successfully downloaded articles;
#  NZBPP_FAILEDARTICLES - number of failed articles;
#  NZBPP_SERVERX_SUCCESSARTICLES - number of successfully downloaded
#                       articles from ServerX (X is replaced with server
#                       number, for example NZBPP_SERVER1_SUCCESSARTICLES);
#  NZBPP_SERVERX_FAILEDARTICLES - number of failed articles from ServerX.
#
# If the script defines own options they are also passed as environment
# variables. These variables have prefix "NZBPO_" in their names. For
# example, option "myoption" will be passed as environment variable
# "NZBPO_myoption" and in addition in uppercase as "NZBPO_MYOPTION".
#
# If the script defines own post-processing parameters, they are also passed as
# environment variables. These variables have prefix "NZBPR_" in their
# names. For example, pp-parameter "myparam" will be passed as environment
# variable "NZBPR_myparam" and in addition in uppercase as "NZBPR_MYPARAM".
#
# In addition to arguments, pp-options and pp-parameters NZBGet passes all
# nzbget.conf-options to pp-script as environment variables. These
# variables have prefix "NZBOP_" and are written in UPPER CASE. For Example
# option "ParRepair" is passed as environment variable "NZBOP_PARREPAIR". The
# dots in option names are replaced with underscores, for example
# "SERVER1_HOST". For options with predefined possible values (yes/no, etc.)
# the values are passed always in lower case.
#
# If the script moves files it can inform the program about new location
# by printing special message into standard output (which is processed
# by NZBGet):
#   echo "[NZB] DIRECTORY=/path/to/moved/files";
# or:
#   echo "[NZB] FINALDIR=/path/to/moved/files";
#
# Command "DIRECTORY" changes the destiantion path of the download and
# affects the scripts executed after the current script as well as the
# program code itself, for example the command "Post-process again"
# will work on new location. Command "FINALDIR" just sets a separate
# property of the download and should be used when the files are moved
# into an existing directory containg other files to avoid the processing
# of those files by other scripts.
#
# To assign post-processing parameters:
#   echo "[NZB] NZBPR_myvar=my value";
#
# The prefix "NZBPR_" will be removed. In this example a post-processing
# parameter with name "myvar" and value "my value" will be associated
# with nzb-file.
#
# To inform NZBGet about bad download:
#   echo "[NZB] MARK=BAD";
#
# Return value: NZBGet processes the exit code returned by the script:
#  93 - post-process successful (status = SUCCESS);
#  94 - post-process failed (status = FAILURE);
#  95 - post-process skipped (status = NONE). Use this code when you script
#       terminates immediateley without doing any job and when this is not
#       a failure termination;
#  92 - request NZBGet to do par-check/repair for current nzb-file.
#
# All other return codes are interpreted as failure (status = FAILURE).

PostScript=

# List of scan scripts to execute before a nzb-file is added to queue.
#
# The scripts in the list must be separated with commas or semicolons. Only
# filenames without path must be used. All scripts must be stored in directory
# pointed by option <ScriptDir>. 
#
# The scripts are executed each time a new file is found in incoming
# directory (option <NzbDir>) or a file is received via RPC (web-interface,
# command "nzbget --append", etc.).
#
# Example: UnzipNzb.sh, ScanNotify.py.
#
# The scripts can unpack archives which were put in incoming directory, make
# filename cleanup, change nzb-name, category, priority and post-processing
# parameters of the nzb-file or do other things.
#
# INFO FOR DEVELOPERS:
# NOTE: This is a short documentation, for more information visit
# http://nzbget.net/Extension_scripts.
#
# NZBGet passes following arguments to the script as environment
# variables:
#  NZBNP_DIRECTORY - path to directory, where file is located. It is a directory
#                    specified by the option <NzbDir> or a subdirectory;
#  NZBNP_FILENAME  - name of file to be processed;
#  NZBNP_NZBNAME   - nzb-name (without path but with extension);
#  NZBNP_CATEGORY  - category of nzb-file;
#  NZBNP_PRIORITY  - priority of nzb-file;
#  NZBNP_TOP  	   - flag indicating that the file will be added to the top
#                    of queue: 0 or 1;
#  NZBNP_PAUSED	   - flag indicating that the file will be added as
#                    paused: 0 or 1;
#  NZBNP_DUPEKEY   - duplicate key of nzb-file;
#  NZBNP_DUPESCORE - duplicate score of nzb-file;
#  NZBNP_DUPEMODE  - duplicate mode of nzb-file: SCORE, ALL, FORCE.
#
# In addition to these arguments NZBGet passes all nzbget.conf-options 
# as environment variables. These variables have prefix "NZBOP_" and
# are written in UPPER CASE. For Example option "ParRepair" is passed as
# environment variable "NZBOP_PARREPAIR". The dots in option names are
# replaced with underscores, for example "SERVER1_HOST". For options
# with predefined possible values (yes/no, etc.) the values are passed
# always in lower case.
#
# The script can change nzb-name, category, priority,
# post-processing parameters and top-/paused-flags of the nzb-file
# by printing special messages into standard output (which is processed
# by NZBGet).
#
# To change nzb-name use following syntax:
#   echo "[NZB] NZBNAME=my download";
#
# To change category:
#   echo "[NZB] CATEGORY=my category";
#
# To change priority:
#   echo "[NZB] PRIORITY=signed_integer_value";
#
# for example: to set priority higher than normal:
#   echo "[NZB] PRIORITY=50";
#
# another example: use a negative value for "lower than normal" priority:
#   echo "[NZB] PRIORITY=-100";
#
# Although priority can be any integer value, the web-interface operates
# with six predefined priorities:
# -100 - very low priority;
# -50  - low priority;
# 0    - normal priority (default);
# 50   - high priority;
# 100  - very high priority;
# 900  - force priority.
#
# Downloads with priorities equal to or greater than 900 are downloaded and
# post-processed even if the program is in paused state (force mode).
#
# To assign post-processing parameters:
#   echo "[NZB] NZBPR_myvar=my value";
#
# The prefix "NZBPR_" will be removed. In this example a post-processing
# parameter with name "myvar" and value "my value" will be associated
# with nzb-file.
#
# To change top-flag (nzb-file will be added to the top of queue):
#   echo "[NZB] TOP=1";
#
# To change paused-flag (nzb-file will be added in paused state):
#   echo "[NZB] PAUSED=1";
#
# To change duplicate key:
#   echo "[NZB] DUPEKEY=tv show s01e02";
#
# To change duplicate score:
#   echo "[NZB] DUPESCORE=integer_value";
#
# To change duplicate mode:
#   echo "[NZB] DUPEMODE=(SCORE|ALL|FORCE)";
#
# The script can delete processed file, rename it or move somewhere.
# After the calling of the script the file will be either added to queue
# (if it was an nzb-file) or renamed by adding the extension ".processed".
#
# NOTE: Files with extensions ".processed", ".queued" and ".error" are skipped
# during the directory scanning.
#
# NOTE: Files with extension ".nzb_processed" are not passed to
# scan-script before adding to queue. This feature allows scan-script
# to prevent the scanning of nzb-files extracted from archives, if
# they were already processed by the script.
#
# NOTE: Files added via RPC calls in particular from web-interface are
# saved into incoming nzb-directory and then processed by the script.
#
# NOTE: This is a short documentation, for more information visit
# http://nzbget.net/Extension_scripts.

# pointed by option <ScriptDir>. 
#
# The scripts are executed on certain queue events such as adding
# a new nzb-file to queue, etc.
#
# Example: DeleteQueueSamples.sh, NzbAddedNotify.py.
#
# The script can modify the files in download queue (for example
# delete or pause all nfo, sfv, sample files) or do something else.
#
# INFO FOR DEVELOPERS:
# NOTE: This is a short documentation, for more information visit
# http://nzbget.net/Extension_scripts.
#
# NZBGet passes following arguments to the queue script as environment
# variables:
#  NZBNA_NZBNAME   - name of nzb-group. This name can be used in calls
#                    to nzbget edit-command using subswitch "-GN name";
#  NZBNA_FILENAME  - filename of the nzb-file. If the file was added
#                    from nzb-directory this is the fullname with path.
#                    If the file was added via web-interface it contains
#                    only filename without path;
#  NZBNA_EVENT     - describes why the script was called:
#                    NZB_ADDED - after adding of nzb-file to queue;
#                    FILE_DOWNLOADED - after a file included in nzb is
#                    downloaded;
#                    NZB_DOWNLOADED - after all files in nzb are downloaded
#                    (before post-processing);
#                    NZB_DELETED - when nzb is deleted from queue (moved
#                    to history). See NZBNA_DELETESTATUS for details;
#                    URL_COMPLETED - after an URL download is completed

#                    In the future the list of supported events may be
#                    extended. To avoid conflicts with future NZBGet
#                    versions the script must exit if the parameter
#                    has a value unknown to the script.
#  NZBNA_DELETESTATUS - delete status info, NZBNA_EVENT=NZB_DELETED:
#                    MANUAL - deleted by user or via API call;

#                    BAD - marked as bad by user or by queue-script;
#                    COPY - already in queue or in history;
#                    SCAN - malformed nzb-file, cannot be parsed;
#  NZBNA_URLSTATUS - URL status info, when NZBNA_EVENT=URL_COMPLETED:
#                    FAILURE - fetch error (could not be downloaded);
#                    SCAN_SKIPPED - downloaded file doesn't have
#                    nzb-extension and was skipped;
#                    SCAN_FAILED - file format error;
#  NZBNA_CATEGORY  - category of nzb-file (if assigned);
#  NZBNA_NZBID     - id of the nzb-file. This ID can be used with

# If you assign multiple scripts to one nzb-file, they are executed in the
# order defined by this option. Scripts not listed here are executed at
# the end in their alphabetical order.
#
# The scripts in the list must be separated with commas or semicolons. Only
# filenames without path must be used. All scripts must be stored in directory
# pointed by option <ScriptDir>. 
#
# Example: Cleanup.sh, Move.sh.
ScriptOrder=

# Pause download queue during executing of postprocess-script (yes, no).
#
# Enable the option to give CPU more time for postprocess-script. That helps
# to speed up postprocess on slow CPUs with fast connection (e.g. NAS-devices).
#
# NOTE: See also options <ParPauseQueue> and <UnpackPauseQueue>.
ScriptPauseQueue=no

# Minimum interval between calls of queue-scripts (seconds).
#
# Queue-scripts are executed during download, after every file included in
# nzb-file is downloaded. If the files are small they may be downloaded
# very fast causing queue-scripts to be working all the time. Sometimes
# this may lead to a performance decrease on systems with slow CPUs.
#
# This option allows to reduce the number of calls of queue-scripts by
# skipping "file-downloaded"-events if the previous call of queue-scripts
# for the same download (nzb-file) were performed a short time ago
# (as defined by the option).
#
# Value "-1" disables executing of queue-scripts on
# "file-downloaded"-events. Scripts are still executed on events
# "nzb-added" and "nzb-downloaded".
#
# NOTE: This options affects only queue-scripts and only
# "file-downloaded"-events. Queue-scripts can be activated using
# option <QueueScript> (for pure queue-scripts) or option <PostScript>
# (for dual-mode scripts which act as queue- and post-processing-scripts
# at the same time).
