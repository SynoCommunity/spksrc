# Sample configuration file for NZBGet
#
# On POSIX put this file to one of the following locations:
# ~/.nzbget
# /etc/nzbget.conf
# /usr/etc/nzbget.conf
# /usr/local/etc/nzbget.conf
# /opt/etc/nzbget.conf
#
# On Windows put this file in program's directory.
#
# You can also put the file into any location, if you specify the path to it
# using switch "-c", e.g:
#   nzbget -c /home/user/myconfig.txt

# For quick start change the option MainDir and configure one news-server

# How old nzb-file should at least be for it to be loaded to queue (seconds).

NzbDirFileAge=60

# Automatic merging of nzb-files with the same filename (yes, no).
#
# A typical scenario: you put nzb-file into incoming directory, NZBGet adds
# file to queue. You find out, that the file doesn't have par-files. You
# find required par-files, put nzb-file with the par-files into incoming
# directory, NZBGet adds it to queue as a separate group. You want the second
# file to be merged with the first for parchecking to work properly. With
# option "MergeNzb" NZBGet can merge files automatically. You only need to
# save the second file under the same filename as the first one.
MergeNzb=no

# Set path to program, that must be executed before any file in incoming
# directory (option <NzbDir>) is processed.
#
# Example: "NzbProcess=~/nzbprocess.sh".
#
# That program can unpack archives which were put in incoming directory, make
# filename cleanup, assign category and post-processing parameters to nzb-file
# or do something else.
#
# INFO FOR DEVELOPERS:
# NZBGet passes following arguments to nzbprocess-program as environment
# variables:
#  NZBNP_DIRECTORY - path to directory, where file is located. It is a directory
#                    specified by the option <NzbDir> or a subdirectory;
#  NZBNP_FILENAME  - name of file to be processed;
#
# In addition to these arguments NZBGet passes all
# nzbget.conf-options to postprocess-program as environment variables. These
# variables have prefix "NZBOP_" and are written in UPPER CASE. For Example
# option "ParRepair" is passed as environment variable "NZBOP_PARREPAIR".
# The dots in option names are replaced with underscores, for example
# "SERVER1_HOST". For options with predefined possible values (yes/no, etc.)
# the values are passed always in lower case.
#
# The nzbprocess-script can assign category, priority and post-processing
# parameters to the current nzb-file by printing special messages into
# standard output (which is processed by NZBGet).
#
# To assign category use following syntax:
#   echo "[NZB] CATEGORY=my category";
#
# To assign priority:
#   echo "[NZB] PRIORITY=signed_integer_value";
#
# for example: to set priority higher than normal:
#   echo "[NZB] PRIORITY=50";
#
# another example: use a negative value for "lower than normal" priority:
#   echo "[NZB] PRIORITY=-100";
#
# To assign post-processing parameters:
#   echo "[NZB] NZBPR_myvar=my value";
#
# The prefix "NZBPR_" will be removed. In this example a post-processing
# parameter with name "myvar" and value "my value" will be associated
# with nzb-file.
#
# The nzbprocess-script can delete processed file, rename it or move somewhere.
# After the calling of the script the file will be either added to queue
# (if it was an nzb-file) or renamed by adding the extension ".processed".
#
# NOTE: Files with extensions ".processed", ".queued" and ".error" are skipped
# during the directory scanning.
#
# NOTE: Files with extension ".nzb_processed" are not passed to
# NzbProcess-script before adding to queue. This feature allows
# NzbProcess-script to prevent the scanning of nzb-files extracted from
# archives, if they were already processed by the script.
NzbProcess=

# Check for duplicate files (yes, no).
#
# If this option is enabled the program checks by adding of a new nzb-file:
# 1) if nzb-file contains duplicate entries. This check aims on detecting
#    of reposted files (if first file was not fully uploaded);
#    If the program find two files with identical names, only the
#    biggest of these files will be added to queue;
# 2) if download queue already contains file with the same name;
# 3) if destination file on disk already exists.
# In last two cases: if the file exists it will not be added to queue;
#
# If this option is disabled, all files are downloaded and duplicate files
# are renamed to "filename_duplicate1".
# Existing files are never deleted or overwritten.

#
# For this option to work the options <SaveQueue> and <ReloadQueue> must

# This allows to continue download of file, if program was exited before
# the file was completed.
ContinuePartial=yes

# Visibly rename broken files on download appending "_broken" (yes, no).
#
# Do not activate this option if par-check is enabled.
RenameBroken=no

# Decode articles (yes, no).
#
# yes - decode articles using internal decoder (supports yEnc and UU formats);
# no - the articles will not be decoded and joined. External programs
#      (like "uudeview") can be used to decode and join downloaded articles.
#      Also useful for debugging to look at article's source text.
Decode=yes

# Write decoded articles directly into destination output file (yes, no).
#
# Files are posted to Usenet within artilce bodies. Each file typically
# requires hundreds of articles.
#
# When option <DirectWrite> is disabled, the program downloads all articles
# into temporary directory and then combine them into destination file.
#
# With this option enabled the program at first creates the output
# destination file with required size (total size of all articles),
# then writes on the fly decoded articles directly to the file
# without creating of any temporary files.
#
# This may improve performance but depends on OS and file system ability to
# instantly create large files without initializing them with nulls. Such
# files are called sparse files and are supported by modern file systems
# like EXT3 on Linux or NTFS on Windows.
#
# Using of this option reduces disk operations but may produce more fragmented
# files (depends on disk driver), which may slow down the post-processing.
# It's recommended to test how the option behave on your platform to find the
# best setting.
#
# INFO: a particular test on a Linux router with EXT3-partition showed that
# activating of this option results in up to 20% better performance during
# downloading.
#
# NOTE: For test try to download few big nzb-collections (each 4GB or more)
# and measure the time used for downloading and post-processing (use timestamps
# in a log-file to determine when the post-processing was ended).
#
# NOTE: When option <DirectWrite> is enabled the temporary directory (option
# <TempDir>) must be located on the same partition with destination directory
# (option DestDir>) for better performance. If option <DirectWrite> is disabled
# it's better to use different drives for temporary and destination directories.
#
# NOTE: If both options <DirectWrite> and <ContinuePartial> are enabled,
# the program still creates empty article-files in temp-directory. They are used
# by the option <ContinuePartial> to check if a certain article was downloaded.
# To minimize disk-io it is recommended to disable option <ContinuePartial>,
# if <DirectWrite> is enabled. Especially on a fast connections (where you
# would want to activate <DirectWrite>) it should not be a problem to redownload
# an interrupted file.
DirectWrite=yes

# Check CRC of downloaded and decoded articles (yes, no).
#
# Normally this option should be enabled for better detecting of download
# errors. However checking of CRC needs about the same CPU time as
# decoding of articles. On a fast connections with slow CPUs disabling of
# CPU-check may slightly improve performance (if CPU is a limiting factor).
CrcCheck=yes

# How much retries should be attempted if a download error occurs (0-99).
Retries=3

# Set the interval between retries (seconds).
RetryInterval=10

# Redownload article if CRC-check fails (yes, no).
#
# Helps to minimize number of broken files, but may be effective
# only if you have multiple download servers (even from the same provider
# but from different locations (e.g. europe, usa)).
# In any case the option increases your traffic.
# For slow connections loading of extra par-blocks may be more effective
# The option <CrcCheck> must be enabled for option <RetryOnCrcError> to work.
RetryOnCrcError=no

# Set connection timeout (seconds).
ConnectionTimeout=60

# Timeout until a download-thread should be killed (seconds).
#
# This can help on hanging downloads, but is dangerous.
# Do not use small values!
TerminateTimeout=600

# Set the (approximate) maximum number of allowed threads (0-999).
#
# Sometimes under certain circumstances the program may create way to many
# download threads. Most of them are in wait-state. That is not bad,
# but threads are usually a limited resource. If a program creates to many
# of them, operating system may kill it. The option <ThreadLimit> prevents that.
#
# NOTE: The number of threads is not the same as the number of connections
# opened to NNTP-servers. Do not use the option <ThreadLimit> to limit the
# number of connections. Use the appropriate options <ServerX.Connections>
# instead.
#
# NOTE: The actual number of created threads can be slightly larger as
# defined by the option. Important threads may be created even if the
# number of threads is exceeded. The option prevents only the creation of
# additional download threads.
#
# NOTE: In most cases you should leave the default value "100" unchanged.
# However you may increase that value if you need more than 90 connections
# (that's very unlikely) or decrease the value if the OS does not allow so
# many threads. But the most OSes should not have problems with 100 threads.
ThreadLimit=100

# Set the maximum download rate on program start (kilobytes/sec).
#
# Value "0" means no speed control.
# The download rate can be changed later via remote calls.
DownloadRate=0

# Accurate speed rate calculation (yes, no).
#
# During downloading using several connections the download threads may
# interfere with each other when updating statistical data for speed meter.
# This may cause calculation errors resulting in a wrong download rate
# reported by the program. This can be critical especially when using download
# rate throttling.
#
# Enable the option to use thread synchronisation mechanisms in order to
# provide accurate speed calculations.
#
# NOTE: The program uses spinlocks if the operating system supports them.
# Otherwise it uses mutexes, which are less effective. In any case the thread
# synchronisation increases CPU load.
#
# NOTE: It is recommended to run tests to determine how the option affects
# the CPU usage and the download speed on a particular system.
#
# NOTE: The average (session) download speed is always accurate. It uses
# other data for speed calculation and is not affected by this option.
AccurateRate=no

# Set the size of memory buffer used by writing the articles (bytes).
#
# Bigger values decrease disk-io, but increase memory usage.
# Value "0" causes an OS-dependent default value to be used.
# With value "-1" (which means "max/auto") the program sets the size of
# buffer according to the size of current article (typically less than 500K).
#
# NOTE: The value must be written in bytes, do not use postfixes "K" or "M".
#
# NOTE: To calculate the memory usage multiply WriteBufferSize by max number
# of connections, configured in section "NEWS-SERVERS".
#
# NOTE: Typical article's size not exceed 500000 bytes, so using bigger values
# (like several megabytes) will just waste memory.
#
# NOTE: For desktop computers with large amount of memory value "-1" (max/auto)
# is recommended, but for computers with very low memory (routers, NAS)
# value "0" (default OS-dependent size) could be better alternative.
#
# NOTE: Write-buffer is managed by OS (system libraries) and therefore
# the effect of the option is highly OS-dependent.
WriteBufferSize=0

# Pause if disk space gets below this value (megabytes).
#
# Value "0" disables the check.
# Only the disk space on the drive with <DestDir> is checked.
# The drive with <TempDir> is not checked.
DiskSpace=250

# Delete already downloaded files from disk, if the download of nzb-file was
# cancelled (nzb-file was deleted from queue) (yes, no).
#
# NOTE: NZBGet does not delete files in a case if all remaining files in
# queue are par-files. That prevents the accidental deletion if the option
# <ParCleanupQueue> is disabled or if the program was interrupted during
# parcheck and later restarted without reloading of post queue (option
# <ReloadPostQueue> disabled).
DeleteCleanupDisk=no

# Keep the history of downloaded nzb-files (days).
#
# Value "0" disables the history.
#
# NOTE: When a collection having paused files is added to history all remaining
# files are moved from download queue to a list of parked files. It holds files
# which could be required later if the collection will be moved back to
# download queue for downloading of remaining files. The parked files still
# consume some amount of memory and disk space. If the collection was downloaded
# and successfully par-checked or postprocessed it is recommended to discard the
# unneeded parked files before adding the collection to history. For par2-files
# that can be achieved with the option <ParCleanupQueue>.
KeepHistory=7

# Maximal number of simultaneous connections for nzb URL downloads (0-999).

# of files (with different par-sets), par-checker may download par-files from
# a wrong collection. This increases you traffic (but not harm par-check).
#
# NOTE: Par-checker always uses only par-files added from the same NZB-file
# and the option <StrictParName> does not change this behavior.
StrictParName=yes

# Maximum allowed time for par-repair (minutes).
#
# Value "0" means unlimited.
#
# If you use NZBGet on a very slow computer like NAS-device, it may be good to
# limit the time allowed for par-repair. NZBGet calculates the estimated time
# required for par-repair. If the estimated value exceeds the limit defined
# here, NZBGet cancels the repair.
#
# To avoid a false cancellation NZBGet compares the estimated time with
# <ParTimeLimit> after the first 5 minutes of repairing, when the calculated
# estimated time is more or less accurate. But in a case if <ParTimeLimit> is
# set to a value smaller than 5 minutes, the comparison is made after the first
# whole minute.
#
# NOTE: The option limits only the time required for repairing. It doesn't
# affect the first stage of parcheck - verification of files. However the
# verification speed is constant, it doesn't depend on files integrity and
# therefore it is not necessary to limit the time needed for the first stage.
#
# NOTE: This option requires an extended version of libpar2 (the original
# version doesn't support the cancelling of repairing). Please refer to
# NZBGet's README for info on how to apply the patch to libpar2.
ParTimeLimit=0

# Pause download queue during check/repair (yes, no).
#
# Enable the option to give CPU more time for par-check/repair. That helps
# to speed up check/repair on slow CPUs with fast connection (e.g. NAS-devices).
#
# NOTE: If parchecker needs additional par-files it temporarily unpauses
# the queue.
#
# NOTE: See also option <PostPauseQueue>.
ParPauseQueue=no

# Cleanup download queue after successful check/repair (yes, no).
#
# Enable this option for automatic deletion of unneeded (paused) par-files
# from download queue after successful check/repair.

### POST-PROCESSING                                                        ###

# Set path to program, that must be executed after the download of nzb-file
# or one collection in nzb-file is completed and possibly par-checked/repaired.
#
# Example: "PostProcess=~/nzbget-postprocess.sh".
#
# NOTE: An example script for unrarring is provided within distribution
# in file "nzbget-postprocess.sh".
#
# INFO FOR DEVELOPERS:
# NZBGet passes following arguments to postprocess-program as environment
# variables:
#  NZBPP_DIRECTORY    - path to destination dir for downloaded files;
#  NZBPP_NZBFILENAME  - name of processed nzb-file;
#  NZBPP_PARFILENAME  - name of par-file or empty string (if no collections were
#                       found);
#  NZBPP_PARSTATUS    - result of par-check:
#                       0 = not checked: par-check disabled or nzb-file does
#                           not contain any par-files;
#                       1 = checked and failed to repair;
#                       2 = checked and successfully repaired;
#                       3 = checked and can be repaired but repair is disabled;
#  NZBPP_NZBCOMPLETED - state of nzb-job:
#                       0 = there are more collections in this nzb-file queued;
#                       1 = this was the last collection in nzb-file;
#  NZBPP_PARFAILED    - indication of failed par-jobs for current nzb-file:
#                       0 = no failed par-jobs;
#                       1 = current par-job or any of the previous par-jobs for
#                           the same nzb-files failed;
#  NZBPP_CATEGORY     - category assigned to nzb-file (can be empty string).
#
# If nzb-file has associated postprocess-parameters (which can be set using
# subcommand <O> of command <-E>, for example: NZBGet -E G O "myvar=hello !" 10)
# or using XML-/JSON-RPC (for example via web-interface), they are also passed
# as environment variables. These variables have prefix "NZBPR_" in their names.
# For example, pp-parameter "myvar" will be passed as environment
# variable "NZBPR_myvar".
#
# In addition to arguments and postprocess-parameters NZBGet passes all
# nzbget.conf-options to postprocess-program as environment variables. These
# variables have prefix "NZBOP_" and are written in UPPER CASE. For Example
# option "ParRepair" is passed as environment variable "NZBOP_PARREPAIR".
# The dots in option names are replaced with underscores, for example
# "SERVER1_HOST". For options with predefined possible values (yes/no, etc.)
# the values are passed always in lower case.
#
# Return value: NZBGet processes the exit code returned by the script:
#  91 - request NZBGet to do par-check/repair for current collection in the
#       current nzb-file;
#  92 - request NZBGet to do par-check/repair for all collections in the
#       current nzb-file;
#  93 - post-process successful (status = SUCCESS);
#  94 - post-process failed (status = FAILURE);
#  95 - post-process skipped (status = NONE);
# All other return codes are interpreted as "status unknown".
#
# The return value is used to display the status of post-processing in
# a history view. In addition to status one or more text messages can be
# passed to history using a special prefix "[HISTORY]" by printing messages
# to standard output. For example:
#   echo "[ERROR] [HISTORY] Unpack failed, not enough disk space";
#
# NOTE: The parameter NZBPP_NZBCOMPLETED is very important and MUST be checked
# even in the simplest scripts.
# If par-check is enabled and nzb-file contains more than one collection
# of files the postprocess-program is called after each collection is completed
# and par-checked. If you want to unpack files or clean up the directory
# (delete par-files, etc.) there are two possibilities, when you can do this:
#  1) you parse NZBPP_PARFILENAME to find out the base name of collection and
#     clean up only files from this collection (not reliable, because par-files
#     sometimes have different names than rar-files);
#  2) or you just check the parameters NZBPP_NZBCOMPLETED and NZBPP_PARFAILED
#     and do the processing, only if NZBPP_NZBCOMPLETED is set to "1" (which
#     means, that this was the last collection in nzb-file and all files
#     are now completed) and NZBPP_PARFAILED is set to "0" (no failed par-jobs);
#
# NOTE: The term "collection" in the above description actually means
# "par-set". To determine what "collections" are present in nzb-file NZBGet
# looks for par-sets. If any collection of files within nzb-file does
# not have any par-files, this collection will not be detected.
# For example, for nzb-file containing three collections but only two par-sets,
# the postprocess will be called two times - after processing of each par-set.
#
# NOTE: If NZBGet doesn't find any collections it calls PostProcess once
# with empty string for parameter NZBPP_PARFILENAME;
#
# NOTE: The using of special return values (91 and 92) for requesting of
# par-check/repair allows to organize the delayed parcheck. To do that:
#   1) set options: LoadPars=one, ParCheck=no, ParRepair=yes;
#   2) in post-process-script check the parameter NZBPP_PARSTATUS. If it is "0",
#      that means, the script is called for the first time. Try to unpack files.
#      If unpack fails, exit the script with exit code for par-check/repair;
#   3) NZBGet will start par-check/repair. After that it calls the script again;
#   4) on second pass the parameter NZBPP_PARSTATUS will have value
#      greater than "0". If it is "2" ("checked and successfully repaired")
#      you can try unpack again.
PostProcess=/usr/local/nzbget/bin/nzbget-postprocess.sh

# Allow multiple post-processing for the same nzb-file (yes, no).
#
# NOTE: Enable this option only if you were advised to do that by the author
# of the post-process-script.
#
# NOTE: By enabling <AllowReProcess> you should disable the option <ParCheck>
# to prevent multiple par-checking.
#
# INFO FOR DEVELOPERS:
# After the post-processing (par-check and call of a postprocess-script) is
# completed, NZBGet adds the nzb-file to a list of completed-jobs. The nzb-file
# stays in the list until the last file from that nzb-file is deleted from
# the download queue (it occurs straight away if the par-check was successful
# and the option <ParCleanupQueue> is enabled).
# That means, if a paused file from a nzb-collection becomes unpaused
# (manually or from a post-process-script) after the collection was already
# postprocessed NZBGet will not post-process nzb-file again.
# This prevents the unwanted multiple post-processings of the same nzb-file.
# But it might be needed if the par-check/-repair are performed not directly
# by NZBGet but from a post-process-script.
AllowReProcess=no

# Pause download queue during executing of postprocess-script (yes, no).
#
# Enable the option to give CPU more time for postprocess-script. That helps
# to speed up postprocess on slow CPUs with fast connection (e.g. NAS-devices).
#
# NOTE: See also option <ParPauseQueue>.
PostPauseQueue=no

### SCHEDULER                                                              ###

# This section defines scheduler commands.
# For each command create a set of options <TaskX.Time>, <TaskX.Command>,
# <TaskX.WeekDays> and <TaskX.DownloadRate>.
# The following example shows how to throttle downloads in the daytime
# by 100 KB/s and download at full speed overnights:

# Time to execute the command (HH:MM).
#
# Multiple comma-separated values are accepted.
# Asterix as hours-part means "every hour".
#
# Examples: "08:00", "00:00,06:00,12:00,18:00", "*:00", "*:00,*:30".
#Task1.Time=08:00

# Week days to execute the command (1-7).
#
# Comma separated list of week days numbers.
# 1 is Monday.
# Character '-' may be used to define ranges.
#
# Examples: "1-7", "1-5", "5,6", "1-5, 7".
#Task1.WeekDays=1-7

# Command to be executed (DownloadRate, PauseDownload, UnpauseDownload, PauseScan,
# UnpauseScan, Process).
#
# Possible commands:
#   DownloadRate    - sets download rate in KB/s;
#   PauseDownload   - pauses download;
#   UnpauseDownload - resumes download;
#   PauseScan       - pauses scan of incoming nzb-directory;
#   UnpauseScan     - resumes scan of incoming nzb-directory;
#   Process         - executes external program.
#Task1.Command=DownloadRate

# Download rate to be set if the command is "DownloadRate" (kilobytes/sec).
#
# Value "0" means no speed control.
#
# If the option <TaskX.Command> is not set to "DownloadRate" this option
# is ignored and can be omitted.
#Task1.DownloadRate=100

# Path to the program to execute if the command is "Process".
#
# Example: "Task1.Process=/home/user/fetch-nzb.sh".
#
# If the option <TaskX.Command> is not set to "Process" this option
# is ignored and can be omitted.
#
# NOTE: It's allowed to add parameters to command line. If filename or
# any parameter contains spaces it must be surrounded with single quotation
# marks. If filename/parameter contains single quotation marks, each of them
# must be replaced with two single quotation marks and the resulting filename/
# parameter must be surrounded with single quotation marks.
# Example: '/home/user/download/my scripts/task process.sh' 'world''s fun'.
# In this example one parameter (world's fun) is passed to the script
# (task process.sh).
#Task1.Process=/home/user/script.sh

#Task2.Time=20:00
#Task2.WeekDays=1-7
#Task2.Command=DownloadRate

## PERFORMANCE                                                              ##

# On a very fast connection and slow CPU and/or drive the following
# settings may improve performance:
# 1) Disable par-checking and -repairing ("ParCheck=no"). VERY important,
#    because par-checking/repairing needs a lot of CPU-power and
#    significantly increases disk usage;
# 2) Try to activate option <DirectWrite> ("DirectWrite=yes"), especially
#    if you use EXT3-partitions (Linux) or NTFS (Windows);
# 3) Disable option <CrcCheck> ("CrcCheck=no");
# 4) Disable option <ContinuePartial> ("ContinuePartial=no");
# 5) Do not limit download rate ("DownloadRate=0"), because the bandwidth
#    throttling eats some CPU time. Disable accurate speed rate
#    meter ("AccurateRate=no");
# 6) Disable logging for detail- and debug-messages ("DetailTarget=none",
#    "DebugTarget=none");
# 7) Run the program in daemon (POSIX) or service (Windows) mode and use
#    remote client for short periods of time needed for controlling of
#    download process on server. Daemon/Service mode eats less CPU
#    resources than console server mode due to not updating the screen.
# 8) Increase the value of option <WriteBufferSize> or better set it to
#    "-1" (max/auto) if you have spare 5-20 MB of memory.
