# NOTICE - Work in Progress
# WireGuard is not yet complete. You should not rely on this code.
# It has not undergone proper degrees of security auditing and the protocol
# is still subject to change. We're working toward a stable 1.0 release,
# but that time has not yet come. There are experimental snapshots tagged
# with "0.0.YYYYMMDD", but these should not be considered real releases and
# they may contain security vulnerabilities (which would not be eligible for CVEs,
# since this is pre-release snapshot software).
# However, if you're interested in helping out, we could really use your help
# and we readily welcome any form of feedback and review.
# There's currently quite a bit of work to do on the project todo list,
# and the more folks testing this out, the better.
