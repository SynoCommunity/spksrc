Issues TODO:
1- 'make wheelclean' fails to clean numpy properly
2- 'pendulum` wheel broken -> Probably needs an update
	-> Temporarily disabled
2- Wheels in wheelhouse are no longer being installed in crossenv?!?!
   Seen with scipy that requires numpy from wheelhouse where instead online
   sources gets priority resulting in failing to build numpy for scipy crossenv
   while cross-compiled version is available in wheelhouse.

Names python 3.14 / 3.13 looks ok:
  numpy-2.2.6-cp314-cp314-linux_aarch64_unknown_linux_gnu.whl
  numpy-2.2.6-cp313-cp313-linux_aarch64_unknown_linux_gnu.whl

Issues fixed:
1- pkgconfig prefix uses INSTALL_PREFIX instead of STAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX
	FIX) ATM using a post_install_target rules in cross/python314 to address the issue
	     -->> To look if install options upstream have changed or open a bug upstream.
2- cross/mysql-connector-c does no longer build using Debian-13 trixie
	FIX) Enable mysql compatibility in mariadb-connector-c and discard old mysql version
3- pydantic_core was migrated to rustc and no longer needs its default crossenv
	FIX) Remove pydantic_core specific requirement files
