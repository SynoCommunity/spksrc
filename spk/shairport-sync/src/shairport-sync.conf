// Configuration File for Shairport Sync
// Commented out settings are generally the defaults, except where noted.
// Some sections are operative only if Shairport Sync has been built with the right configuration flags.
// See the individual sections for details.

// General Settings
general =
{
//	name = "%H"; // This means "Hostname" -- see below. This is the name the service will advertise to iTunes.
//		The default is "Hostname" -- i.e. the machine's hostname with the first letter capitalised (ASCII only.)
//		You can use the following substitutions:
//				%h for the hostname,
//				%H for the Hostname (i.e. with first letter capitalised (ASCII only)),
//				%v for the version number, e.g. 3.0 and
//				%V for the full version string, e.g. 3.3-OpenSSL-Avahi-ALSA-soxr-metadata-sysconfdir:/etc
//		Overall length can not exceed 50 characters. Example: "Shairport Sync %v on %H".
//	password = "secret"; // leave this commented out if you don't want to require a password
//	interpolation = "auto"; // aka "stuffing". Default is "auto". Alternatives are "basic" or "soxr". Choose "soxr" only if you have a reasonably fast processor and Shairport Sync has been built with "soxr" support.
//	output_backend = "alsa"; // Run "shairport-sync -h" to get a list of all output_backends, e.g. "alsa", "pipe", "stdout". The default is the first one.
//	mdns_backend = "avahi"; // Run "shairport-sync -h" to get a list of all mdns_backends. The default is the first one.
	port = 8303; // Listen for service requests on this port
	udp_port_base = 8304; // start allocating UDP ports from this port number when needed
	udp_port_range = 10; // look for free ports in this number of places, starting at the UDP port base. Allow at least 10, though only three are needed in a steady state.
//	drift_tolerance_in_seconds = 0.002; // allow a timing error of this number of seconds of drift away from exact synchronisation before attempting to correct it
//	resync_threshold_in_seconds = 0.050; // a synchronisation error greater than this number of seconds will cause resynchronisation; 0 disables it
//	ignore_volume_control = "no"; // set this to "yes" if you want the volume to be at 100% no matter what the source's volume control is set to.
//	volume_range_db = 60 ; // use this advanced setting to set the range, in dB, you want between the maximum volume and the minimum volume. Range is 30 to 150 dB. Leave it commented out to use mixer's native range.
//	volume_max_db = 0.0 ; // use this advanced setting, which must have a decimal point in it, to set the maximum volume, in dB, you wish to use.
//		The setting is for the hardware mixer, if chosen, or the software mixer otherwise. The value must be in the mixer's range (0.0 to -96.2 for the software mixer).
//		Leave it commented out to use mixer's maximum volume.
//	volume_control_profile = "standard" ; // use this advanced setting to specify how the airplay volume is transferred to the mixer volume.
//		"standard" makes the volume change more quickly at lower volumes and slower at higher volumes.
//		"flat" makes the volume change at the same rate at all volumes.
//	volume_range_combined_hardware_priority = "no"; // when extending the volume range by combining the built-in software attenuator with the hardware mixer attenuator, set this to "yes" to reduce volume by using the hardware mixer first, then the built-in software attenuator.
//	run_this_when_volume_is_set = "/full/path/to/application/and/args"; //	Run the specified application whenever the volume control is set or changed.
//		The desired AirPlay volume is appended to the end of the command line â€“ leave a space if you want it treated as an extra argument.
//		AirPlay volume goes from 0 to -30 and -144 means "mute".

//	regtype = "_raop._tcp"; // Use this advanced setting to set the service type and transport to be advertised by Zeroconf/Bonjour. Default is "_raop._tcp".
//	playback_mode = "stereo"; // This can be "stereo", "mono", "reverse stereo", "both left" or "both right". Default is "stereo".
//	alac_decoder = "hammerton"; // This can be "hammerton" or "apple". This advanced setting allows you to choose
//		the original Shairport decoder by David Hammerton or the Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) decoder written by Apple.
//		If you build Shairport Sync with the flag --with-apple-alac, the Apple ALAC decoder will be chosen by default.
//	interface = "name"; // Use this advanced setting to specify the interface on which Shairport Sync should provide its service. Leave it commented out to get the default, which is to select the interface(s) automatically.

//	audio_backend_buffer_desired_length_in_seconds = 0.2; // If set too small, buffer underflow occurs on low-powered machines. Too long and the response time to volume changes becomes annoying. Default is 0.15 seconds in the alsa backend, 0.35 seconds in the pa backend and 1.0 seconds otherwise.
//	audio_backend_buffer_interpolation_threshold_in_seconds = 0.075; // Advanced feature. If the buffer size drops below this, stop using time-consuming interpolation like soxr to avoid dropouts due to underrun.
//	audio_backend_silent_lead_in_time = 2.0; // This optional advanced setting, from 0.0 and 4.0 seconds, sets the length of the period of silence that precedes the start of the audio. The default is the latency, usually 2.0 seconds. Values greater than the latency are ignored. Values that are too low will affect initial synchronisation.
//	dbus_service_bus = "system"; // The Shairport Sync dbus interface, if selected at compilation, will appear
//		as "org.gnome.ShairportSync" on the whichever bus you specify here: "system" (default) or "session".
//	mpris_service_bus = "system"; // The Shairport Sync mpris interface, if selected at compilation, will appear
//		as "org.gnome.ShairportSync" on the whichever bus you specify here: "system" (default) or "session".
//	resend_control_first_check_time = 0.10; // Use this optional advanced setting to set the wait time in seconds before deciding a packet is missing.
//	resend_control_check_interval_time = 0.25; //  Use this optional advanced setting to set the time in seconds between requests for a missing packet.
//	resend_control_last_check_time = 0.10; // Use this optional advanced setting to set the latest time, in seconds, by which the last check should be done before the estimated time of a missing packet's transfer to the output buffer.
