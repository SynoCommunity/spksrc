//	The default is "Hostname" -- i.e. the machine's hostname with the first letter capitalised (ASCII only.)
//	You can use the following substitutions:
//	%h for the hostname,
//	%H for the Hostname (i.e. with first letter capitalised (ASCII only)),
//	%v for the version number, e.g. 2.8.5 and
//	%V for the full version string, e.g. 2.8.5-OpenSSL-Avahi-ALSA-soxr-metadata-sysconfdir:/etc
//	Overall length can not exceed 50 characters. Example: "Shairport Sync %v on %H".
//	password = "secret"; // leave this commented out if you don't want to require a password
//	interpolation = "basic"; // aka "stuffing". Default is "basic", alternative is "soxr". Use "soxr" only if you have a reasonably fast processor.
//	output_backend = "alsa"; // Run "shairport-sync -h" to get a list of all output_backends, e.g. "alsa", "pipe", "stdout". The default is the first one.
//	mdns_backend = "avahi"; // Run "shairport-sync -h" to get a list of all mdns_backends. The default is the first one.

//	volume_range_db = 60 ; // use this to set the range, in dB, you want between the maximum volume and the minimum volume. Range is 30 to 150 dB. Leave it commented out to use mixer's native range.
