# If a file has been archieved under an ISO-8859 environment and unarchived
# under an UTF8 environment, then you will get an encoding format problem.
# The file will not be readable through SAMBA.
#
# Renaming script for SABnzbd runnning under Synology NAS.
# By default the NZB software is running under UTF-8 encoding format
# in order to correctly handle the french accents (ιθΰη...) a SABnzbd
# post-script must be run in order to convert the file encoding.
#
# To fix this problem, you must convert the encoding format
# to the UTF8 (default Synology encoding)
# The script is trying to detect if the original file/directory are coming
# from a RAR archive. In this case the unrar command on your Syno system will
# unpack in CP437 format (DOS).
# NB: in all cases, files will be readable through samba, even if the detection
# failed. But converted characters will not be good, ex: Ξ? instead ι
# 
# Remark: I guess it should work for any other encoding style. Just replace
# ISO-8859-15 (Western Europe) by the one coresponding to your country:

# 12-04-22 |   1.0   | Initial version
# 12-04-22 |   1.1   | Change encoding to ISO-8859-15
#                    | Added CP437 special characters (0x80-0x9A)
# 12-04-24 |   1.2   | Mixed encoding is now supported
#                    | UTF-8 encoding format detected
# 12-04-24 |   1.3   | Fixed typo line 57 (test must be 0xA0, not 0xA1)
