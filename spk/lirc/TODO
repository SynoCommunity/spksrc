test compile other architectures?
play with config file editor package?


DONE:
proper integration of irexec / lircrc (send_ir.sh)
export path so lirc binaries are accessible?
setup installation wizard to select driver and appropriately propogate
compile with all drivers (except wpc8769l)
provide sample base lircd.conf and lircrc
push to my git branch!
fix kernel source dependency (hacked in as a cross package - not thrilled about it)
final touches in installer.sh (upgrade commands?)
