# original dependency does not work with openssl3:
# We pin cryptography to 3.4.8 due to a build error that occurs with the
# current version (36.0.0 at the time of this commit). In short, building
# the cryptography package with Rust results in a segfault, so we need to
# set the CRYPTOGRAPHY_DONT_BUILD_RUST env var to force the package to build
# with C instead. This env var is only present in cryptography<3.5.
