# A quick guide to configuring OwnTone:
#
# For regular use, the most important setting to configure is "directories",
# which should be the location of your media. Whatever user you have set as
# "uid" must have read access to this location. If the location is a network
# mount, please see the README.
#
# In all likelihood, that's all you need to do!
