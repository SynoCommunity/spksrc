[general]
; There is only a single option that may be defined in this file.
; The cc_max_requests option is a global limit on the number of
; CC requests that may be in the Asterisk system at any time.
;
;cc_max_requests = 20
;
;
;============================================
;           PLEASE READ THIS!!!
; The options described below should NOT be
; set in this file. Rather, they should be
; set per-device in a channel driver
; configuration file.
;           PLEASE READ THIS!!!
;===========================================
;
;---------------------------------------------------------------------
;                                Timers
;---------------------------------------------------------------------
;There are three configurable timers for all types of CC: the
;cc_offer_timer, the ccbs_available_timer, and the ccnr_available_timer.
;In addition, when using a generic agent, there is a fourth timer,
;the cc_recall_timer. All timers are configured in seconds, and the
;values shown below are the defaults.
;
;When a caller is offered CCBS or CCNR, the cc_offer_timer will
;be started. If the caller does not request CC before the
;cc_offer_timer expires, then the caller will be unable to request
;CC for this call.
;
;cc_offer_timer = 20
;
;Once a caller has requested CC, then either the ccbs_available_timer
;or the ccnr_available_timer will run, depending on the service
;requested. The reason why there are two separate timers for CCBS
;and CCNR is that it is reasonable to want to have a shorter timeout
;configured for CCBS than for CCNR. If the available timer expires
;before the called party becomes available, then the CC attempt
;will have failed and monitoring of the called party will stop.
;
;ccbs_available_timer = 4800
;ccnr_available_timer = 7200
;
; When using a generic agent, the original caller is called back
; when one of the original called parties becomes available. The
; cc_recall_timer tells Asterisk how long it should let the original
; caller's phone ring before giving up. Please note that this parameter
; only affects operation when using a generic agent.
;
;cc_recall_timer = 20
;---------------------------------------------------------------------
;                                Policies
;---------------------------------------------------------------------
; Policy settings tell Asterisk how to behave and what sort of
; resources to allocate in order to facilitate CC. There are two
; settings to control the actions Asterisk will take.
;
; The cc_agent_policy describes the behavior that Asterisk will
; take when communicating with the caller during CC. There are
; three possible options.
;
;never:   Never offer CC to the caller. Setting the cc_agent_policy
;         to this value is the way to disable CC for a call.
;
;generic: A generic CC agent is one which uses no protocol-specific
;         mechanisms to offer CC to the caller. Instead, the caller
;         requests CC using a dialplan function. Due to internal
;         restrictions, you should only use a generic CC agent on
;         phones (i.e. not "trunks"). If you are using phones which
;         do not support a protocol-specific method of using CC, then
;         generic CC agents are what you should use.
;
;native:  A native CC agent is one which uses protocol-specific
;         signaling to offer CC to the caller and accept CC requests
;         from the caller. The supported protocols for native CC
;         agents are SIP, ISDN ETSI PTP, ISDN ETSI PTMP, and Q.SIG
;cc_agent_policy=never
;
; The cc_monitor_policy describes the behavior that Asterisk will
; take when communicating with the called party during CC. There
; are four possible options.
;
;never:   Analogous to the cc_agent_policy setting. We will never
;         attempt to request CC services on this interface.
;
;generic: Analogous to the cc_agent_policy setting. We will monitor
;         the called party's progress using protocol-agnostic
;         capabilities. Like with generic CC agents, generic CC
;         monitors should only be used for phones.
;
;native:  Analogous to the cc_agent_policy setting. We will use
;         protocol-specific methods to request CC from this interface
;         and to monitor the interface for availability.
;
;always:  If an interface is set to "always," then we will accept
;         protocol-specific CC offers from the caller and use
;         a native CC monitor for the remainder of the CC transaction.
;         However, if the interface does not offer protocol-specific
;         CC, then we will fall back to using a generic CC monitor
;         instead. This is a good setting to use for phones for which
;         you do not know if they support protocol-specific CC
;         methodologies.
;cc_monitor_policy=never
;
;
;---------------------------------------------------------------------
;                              Limits
;---------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; The use of CC requires Asterisk to potentially use more memory than
; some administrators would like. As such, it is a good idea to limit
; the number of CC requests that can be in the system at a given time.
; The values shown below are the defaults.
;
; The cc_max_agents setting limits the number of outstanding CC
; requests a caller may have at any given time. Please note that due
; to implementation restrictions, this setting is ignored when using
; generic CC agents. Generic CC agents may only have one outstanding
; CC request.
;
;cc_max_agents = 5
;
; The cc_max_monitors setting limits the number of outstanding CC
; requests can be made to a specific interface at a given time.
;
;cc_max_monitors = 5
;
;---------------------------------------------------------------------
;                            Other
;---------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; When using a generic CC agent, the caller who requested CC will be
; called back when a called party becomes available. When the caller
; answers his phone, the administrator may opt to have a macro run.
; What this macro does is up to the administrator. By default there
; is no callback macro configured.
;
;cc_callback_macro=
;
; When using an ISDN phone and a generic CC agent, Asterisk is unable
; to determine the dialstring that should be used when calling back
; the original caller. Furthermore, if you desire to use any dialstring-
; specific options, such as distinctive ring, you must set this
; configuration option. For non-ISDN phones, it is not necessary to
; set this, since Asterisk can determine the dialstring to use since
; it is identical to the name of the calling device. By default, there
; is no cc_agent_dialstring set.
;
;cc_agent_dialstring=
