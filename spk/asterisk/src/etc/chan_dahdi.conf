;
; You need to restart Asterisk to re-configure the DAHDI channel
; CLI> module reload chan_dahdi.so
;      will reload the configuration file, but not all configuration options
;      are re-configured during a reload (signalling, as well as PRI and
;      SS7-related settings cannot be changed on a reload).
;
; This file documents many configuration variables.  Normally unless you know
; what a variable means or that it should be changed, there's no reason to
; un-comment those lines.
;
; Examples below that are commented out (those lines that begin with a ';' but
; no space afterwards) typically show a value that is not the default value,
; but would make sense under certain circumstances. The default values are
; usually sane. Thus you should typically not touch them unless you know what
; they mean or you know you should change them.

;
; Trunk groups are used for NFAS connections.
;
; Group: Defines a trunk group.
;        trunkgroup => <trunkgroup>,<dchannel>[,<backup1>...]
;
;        trunkgroup  is the numerical trunk group to create
;        dchannel    is the DAHDI channel which will have the
;                    d-channel for the trunk.
;        backup1     is an optional list of backup d-channels.

;          Indicate to the called party that the call will be reverse charged.
; K(n)   Keypad digits n
;          Send out the specified digits as keypad digits.
;
; PRI Dialplan: The ISDN-level Type Of Number (TON) or numbering plan, used for
; the dialed number.  For most installations, leaving this as 'unknown' (the
; default) works in the most cases.  In some very unusual circumstances, you
; may need to set this to 'dynamic' or 'redundant'.  Note that if you set one
; of the others, you will be unable to dial another class of numbers.  For
; example, if you set 'national', you will be unable to dial local or
; international numbers.
;
; PRI Local Dialplan:  Only RARELY used for PRI (sets the calling number's
; numbering plan).  In North America, the typical use is sending the 10 digit
; callerID number and setting the prilocaldialplan to 'national' (the default).
; Only VERY rarely will you need to change this.

; U - Unknown
; I - International
; N - National
; L - Local (Net Specific)
; S - Subscriber
; V - Abbreviated
; R - Reserved (should probably never be used but is included for completeness)

; n - National
; p - Private
; r - Reserved (should probably never be used but is included for completeness)
;
; You may also set the prilocaldialplan in the same way, but by prefixing the
; Caller*ID Number, rather than the dialled number.  Please note that telcos

; Stutter dialtone support: If a mailbox is specified without a voicemail

;
; If a mailbox is specified *with* a voicemail context, the same will result
; if voicemail received in mailbox in the specified voicemail context.
;
; for default voicemail context, the example below is fine:
;
;mailbox=1234
;

; Enable echo cancellation
; Use either "yes", "no", or a power of two from 32 to 256 if you wish to
; actually set the number of taps of cancellation.
;
; Note that when setting the number of taps, the number 256 does not translate
; to 256 ms of echo cancellation.  echocancel=256 means 256 / 8 = 32 ms.
;
; Note that if any of your DAHDI cards have hardware echo cancellers,
; then this setting only turns them on and off; numeric settings will
; be treated as "yes". There are no special settings required for
; hardware echo cancellers; when present and enabled in their kernel
; modules, they take precedence over the software echo canceller compiled
; into DAHDI automatically.
;
;
echocancel=yes
;
; Some DAHDI echo cancellers (software and hardware) support adjustable
; parameters; these parameters can be supplied as additional options to
; the 'echocancel' setting. Note that Asterisk does not attempt to
; validate the parameters or their values, so if you supply an invalid
; parameter you will not know the specific reason it failed without
; checking the kernel message log for the error(s) put there by DAHDI.
;
;echocancel=128,param1=32,param2=0,param3=14
;
; Generally, it is not necessary (and in fact undesirable) to echo cancel when
; the circuit path is entirely TDM.  You may, however, change this behavior
; by enabling the echo canceller during pure TDM bridging below.
;
echocancelwhenbridged=yes
;
; In some cases, the echo canceller doesn't train quickly enough and there
; is echo at the beginning of the call.  Enabling echo training will cause
; DAHDI to briefly mute the channel, send an impulse, and use the impulse
; response to pre-train the echo canceller so it can start out with a much
; closer idea of the actual echo.  Value may be "yes", "no", or a number of
; milliseconds to delay before training (default = 400)
;
; WARNING:  In some cases this option can make echo worse!  If you are
; trying to debug an echo problem, it is worth checking to see if your echo
; is better with the option set to yes or no.  Use whatever setting gives
; the best results.
;
; Note that these parameters do not apply to hardware echo cancellers.

; If you are having trouble with DTMF detection, you can relax the DTMF

;
; You may also set the default receive and transmit gains (in dB)
;
; Gain Settings: increasing / decreasing the volume level on a channel.
;                The values are in db (decibells). A positive number
;                increases the volume level on a channel, and a
;                negavive value decreases volume level.
;
; Dynamic Range Compression: you can also enable dynamic range compression
;                on a channel. This will amplify quiet sounds while leaving
;                louder sounds untouched. This is useful in situations where
;                a linear gain setting would cause clipping. Acceptable values
;                are in the range of 0.0 to around 6.0 with higher values
;                causing more compression to be done.
;
;                There are several independent gain settings:
;   rxgain: gain for the rx (receive - into Asterisk) channel. Default: 0.0
;   txgain: gain for the tx (transmit - out of Asterisk Asterisk) channel.
;           Default: 0.0
;   cid_rxgain: set the gain just for the caller ID sounds Asterisk
;               emits. Default: 5.0 .
;   rxdrc: dynamic range compression for the rx channel. Default: 0.0

;
; NOTE: In make menuselect, you'll find further options to tweak the busy

; silence (as many countries do), consider enabling the
; BUSYDETECT_COMPARE_TONE_AND_SILENCE option.

; To further detect which hangup tone your telco provider is sending, it is

; ----------------- SS7 Options ----------------------------------------

; ---------------- Options for use with signalling=mfcr2 --------------

; MFC-R2 signaling has lots of variants from country to country and even sometimes
; minor variants inside the same country. The only mandatory parameters here are:
; mfcr2_variant, mfcr2_max_ani and mfcr2_max_dnis.
; IT IS RECOMMENDED that you leave the default values (leaving it commented) for the 
; other parameters unless you have problems or you have been instructed to change some 
; parameter. OpenR2 library uses the mfcr2_variant parameter to try to determine the 
; best defaults for your country, also refer to the OpenR2 package directory 
; doc/asterisk/ where you can find sample configurations for some countries. If you 
; want to contribute your configs for a particular country send them to the e-mail 
; of the primary OpenR2 developer that you can find in the AUTHORS file of the OpenR2 package

; MFC/R2 variant. This depends on the OpenR2 supported variants
; A list of values can be found by executing the openr2 command r2test -l
; some valid values are:
; ar (Argentina)
; br (Brazil)
; mx (Mexico)
; ph (Philippines)
; itu (per ITU spec)
; mfcr2_variant=mx

; Max amount of ANI to ask for
; mfcr2_max_ani=10

; Max amount of DNIS to ask for
; mfcr2_max_dnis=4

; whether or not to get the ANI before getting DNIS.
; some telcos require ANI first some others do not care
; if this go wrong, change this value
; mfcr2_get_ani_first=no

; Caller Category to send
; national_subscriber
; national_priority_subscriber
; international_subscriber
; international_priority_subscriber
; collect_call
; usually national_subscriber works just fine
; you can change this setting from the dialplan
; by setting the variable MFCR2_CATEGORY
; (remember to set _MFCR2_CATEGORY from originating channels)
; MFCR2_CATEGORY will also be a variable available in your context
; on incoming calls set to the value received from the far end
; mfcr2_category=national_subscriber

; Call logging is stored at the Asterisk
; logging directory specified in asterisk.conf
; plus mfcr2/<whatever you put here>
; if you specify 'span1' here and asterisk.conf has
; as logging directory /var/log/asterisk then the full
; path to your MFC/R2 call logs will be /var/log/asterisk/mfcr2/span1
; (the directory will be automatically created if not present already)
; remember to set mfcr2_call_files=yes
; mfcr2_logdir=span1

; whether or not to drop call files into mfcr2_logdir
; mfcr2_call_files=yes|no

; MFC/R2 valid logging values are: all,error,warning,debug,notice,cas,mf,stack,nothing
; error,warning,debug and notice are self-descriptive
; 'cas' is for logging ABCD CAS tx and rx
; 'mf' is for logging of the Multi Frequency tones
; 'stack' is for very verbose output of the channel and context call stack, only useful
; if you are debugging a crash or want to learn how the library works. The stack logging
; will be only enabled if the openr2 library was compiled with -DOR2_TRACE_STACKS
; You can mix up values, like: loglevel=error,debug,mf to log just error, debug and
; multi frequency messages
; 'all' is a special value to log all the activity
; 'nothing' is a clean-up value, in case you want to not log any activity for
; a channel or group of channels
; BE AWARE that the level of output logged will ALSO depend on
; the value you have in logger.conf, if you disable output in logger.conf
; then it does not matter you specify 'all' here, nothing will be logged
; so logger.conf has the last word on what is going to be logged
; mfcr2_logging=all

; MFC/R2 value in milliseconds for the MF timeout. Any negative value
; means 'default', smaller values than 500ms are not recommended
; and can cause malfunctioning. If you experience protocol error
; due to MF timeout try incrementing this value in 500ms steps
; mfcr2_mfback_timeout=-1

; MFC/R2 value in milliseconds for the metering pulse timeout.
; Metering pulses are sent by some telcos for some R2 variants
; during a call presumably for billing purposes to indicate costs,
; however this pulses use the same signal that is used to indicate
; call hangup, therefore a timeout is sometimes required to distinguish
; between a *real* hangup and a billing pulse that should not
; last more than 500ms, If you experience call drops after some
; minutes of being stablished try setting a value of some ms here,
; values greater than 500ms are not recommended.
; BE AWARE that choosing the proper protocol mfcr2_variant parameter
; implicitly sets a good recommended value for this timer, use this
; parameter only when you *really* want to override the default, otherwise
; just comment out this value or put a -1
; Any negative value means 'default'.
; mfcr2_metering_pulse_timeout=-1

; Brazil uses a special calling party category for collect calls (llamadas por cobrar)
; instead of using the operator (as in Mexico). The R2 spec in Brazil says a special GB tone
; should be used to reject collect calls. If you want to ALLOW collect calls specify 'yes',
; if you want to BLOCK collect calls then say 'no'. Default is to block collect calls.
; (see also 'mfcr2_double_answer')
; mfcr2_allow_collect_calls=no

; This feature is related but independent of mfcr2_allow_collect_calls
; Some PBX's require a double-answer process to block collect calls, if
; you ever have problems blocking collect calls using Group B signals (mfcr2_allow_collect_calls=no)
; then you may want to try with mfcr2_double_answer=yes, this will cause that every answer signal
; is changed by answer->clear back->answer (sort of a flash)
; (see also 'mfcr2_allow_collect_calls')
; mfcr2_double_answer=no

; This feature allows to skip the use of Group B/II signals and go directly
; to the accepted state for incoming calls
; mfcr2_immediate_accept=no

; You most likely dont need this feature. Default is yes.
; When this is set to yes, all calls that are offered (incoming calls) which
; DNIS is valid (exists in extensions.conf) and pass collect call validation
; will be accepted with a Group B tone (either call with charge or not, depending on mfcr2_charge_calls)
; with this set to 'no' then the call will NOT be accepted on offered, and the call will start its
; execution in extensions.conf without being accepted until the channel is answered (either with Answer() or
; any other application resulting in the channel being answered).
; This can be set to 'no' if your telco or PBX needs the hangup cause to be set accurately
; when this option is set to no you must explicitly accept the call with DAHDIAcceptR2Call
; or implicitly through the Answer() application.
; mfcr2_accept_on_offer=yes

; Skip request of calling party category and ANI
; you need openr2 >= 1.2.0 to use this feature
; mfcr2_skip_category=no

; WARNING: advanced users only! I really mean it
; this parameter is commented by default because
; YOU DON'T NEED IT UNLESS YOU REALLY GROK MFC/R2
; READ COMMENTS on doc/r2proto.conf in openr2 package
; for more info
; mfcr2_advanced_protocol_file=/path/to/r2proto.conf

; Brazil use a special signal to force the release of the line (hangup) from the
; backward perspective. When mfcr2_forced_release=no, the normal clear back signal
; will be sent on hangup, which is OK for all mfcr2 variants I know of, except for
; Brazilian variant, where the central will leave the line up for several seconds (30, 60)
; which sometimes is not what people really want. When mfcr2_forced_release=yes, a different
; signal will be sent to hangup the call indicating that the line should be released immediately
; mfcr2_forced_release=no

; Whether or not report to the other end 'accept call with charge'
; This setting has no effect with most telecos, usually is safe
; leave the default (yes), but once in a while when interconnecting with
; old PBXs this may be useful.
; Concretely this affects the Group B signal used to accept calls
; The application DAHDIAcceptR2Call can also be used to decide this
; in the dial plan in a per-call basis instead of doing it here for all calls
; mfcr2_charge_calls=yes

; ---------------- END of options to be used with signalling=mfcr2

; Configuration Sections
; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
; You can also configure channels in a separate chan_dahdi.conf section. In
; this case the keyword 'channel' is not used. Instead the keyword
; 'dahdichan' is used (as in users.conf) - configuration is only processed
; in a section where the keyword dahdichan is used. It will only be
; processed in the end of the section. Thus the following section:
;
;[phones]
;echocancel = 64
;dahdichan = 1-8
;group = 1
;
; Is somewhat equivalent to the following snippet in the section
; [channels]:
;
;echocancel = 64
;group = 1
;channel => 1-8
;
; When starting a new section almost all of the configuration values are
; copied from their values at the end of the section [channels] in
; chan_dahdi.conf and [general] in users.conf - one section's configuration
; does not affect another one's.
;
; Instead of letting common configuration values "slide through" you can
; use configuration templates to easily keep the common part in one
; place and override where needed.
;
;[phones](!)
;echocancel = yes
;group = 0,4
;callgroup = 3
;pickupgroup = 3
;threewaycalling = yes
;transfer = yes
;context = phones
