                                ; Set per parking lot.
context => parkedcalls          ; Which context parked calls are in (default parking lot)
                                ; Set per parking lot.
;parkinghints = no              ; Add hints priorities automatically for parking slots (default is no).
                                ; Set per parking lot.
;parkingtime => 45              ; Number of seconds a call can be parked before returning.
                                ; Set per parking lot. (default is 45 seconds)

;comebacktoorigin = yes         ; Setting this option configures the behavior of call parking when the
                                ; parked call times out (See the parkingtime option).  The default value is 'yes'.

                                ;         that parked this call.  This is done by saving off the name of the channel
                                ;         that parked the call.
                                ;
                                ; 'no'  - This option is useful for performing custom dialplan functionality prior to

                                ;         an entirely different destination.

                                ;         will be the 'parkedcallstimeout' context.  The extension will be built from
                                ;         the saved channel name that parked the call.  For example, if a SIP peer named
                                ;         '0004F2040001' parked this call, the extension will be 'SIP_0004F2040001'.
                                ;         (Note that an underscore is used here because the '/' character has a special
                                ;         meaning in extension names for CallerID matching.)  If this extension does not
                                ;         exist, the call will be sent to the 's' extension, instead.  Finally, if the 's'
                                ;         extension of 'parkedcallstimeout' does not exist, the call will fall back to the
                                ;         's' extension of the 'default' context.
                                ;
                                ;         Additionally, in this example an extension of 'SIP_0004F2040001' will be
                                ;         created in the 'park-dial' context.  This extension will be set up to do a

;
;*** Define another parking lot
;
; You can set parkinglot with the CHANNEL dialplan function
; or by setting 'parkinglot' directly in the channel configuration file.
;
; (Note: Leading '0's and any non-numerical characters on parkpos extensions
;  will be ignored.  Parkext on the other hand can be any string.)
;
;[parkinglot_edvina]
;context => edvinapark
;parkext => 799
;parkpos => 800-850
;findslot => next

; Note that the DTMF features listed below only work when two channels have answered and are bridged together.
; They can not be used while the remote party is ringing or in progress. If you require this feature you can use
; chan_local in combination with Answer to accomplish it.

[applicationmap]
; Note that the DYNAMIC_FEATURES channel variable must be set to use the features
; defined here.  The value of DYNAMIC_FEATURES should be the names of the features
; to allow the channel to use separated by '#'.  For example:
;
;    Set(__DYNAMIC_FEATURES=myfeature1#myfeature2#myfeature3)
;
; (Note: The two leading underscores allow these feature settings to be set on
;  on the outbound channels, as well.  Otherwise, only the original channel
;  will have access to these features.)
;
; The syntax for declaring a dynamic feature is any of the following:
;
;<FeatureName> => <DTMF_sequence>,<ActivateOn>[/<ActivatedBy>],<Application>[,<AppArguments>[,MOH_Class]]
;<FeatureName> => <DTMF_sequence>,<ActivateOn>[/<ActivatedBy>],<Application>[,"<AppArguments>"[,MOH_Class]]
;<FeatureName> => <DTMF_sequence>,<ActivateOn>[/<ActivatedBy>],<Application>([<AppArguments>])[,MOH_Class]

;
;  FeatureName   -> This is the name of the feature used when setting the
;                   DYNAMIC_FEATURES variable to enable usage of this feature.
;  DTMF_sequence -> This is the key sequence used to activate this feature.
;  ActivateOn    -> This is the channel of the call that the application will be executed
;                   on. Valid values are "self" and "peer". "self" means run the
;                   application on the same channel that activated the feature. "peer"
;                   means run the application on the opposite channel from the one that
;                   has activated the feature.
;  ActivatedBy   -> This is which channel is allowed to activate this feature. Valid
;                   values are "caller", "callee", and "both". "both" is the default.
;                   The "caller" is the channel that executed the Dial application, while
;                   the "callee" is the channel called by the Dial application.
;  Application   -> This is the application to execute.
;  AppArguments  -> These are the arguments to be passed into the application.  If you need
;                   commas in your arguments, you should use either the second or third
;                   syntax, above.
;  MOH_Class     -> This is the music on hold class to play while the idle
;                   channel waits for the feature to complete. If left blank,
;                   no music will be played.
;

;
; IMPORTANT NOTE: The applicationmap is not intended to be used for all Asterisk
;   applications. When applications are used in extensions.conf, they are executed
;   by the PBX core. In this case, these applications are executed outside of the
;   PBX core, so it does *not* make sense to use any application which has any
;   concept of dialplan flow. Examples of this would be things like Macro, Goto,
;   Background, WaitExten, and many more.
;
; Enabling these features means that the PBX needs to stay in the media flow and
; media will not be re-directed if DTMF is sent in the media stream.
;
; Example Usage:
;
;testfeature => #9,peer,Playback,tt-monkeys  ;Allow both the caller and callee to play
;                                            ;tt-monkeys to the opposite channel
;
; Set arbitrary channel variables, based upon CALLERID number (Note that the application
; argument contains commas)
;retrieveinfo => #8,peer,Set(ARRAY(CDR(mark),CDR(name))=${ODBC_FOO(${CALLERID(num)})})
;
;pauseMonitor   => #1,self/callee,Pausemonitor     ;Allow the callee to pause monitoring
;                                                  ;on their channel
;unpauseMonitor => #3,self/callee,UnPauseMonitor   ;Allow the callee to unpause monitoring
;                                                  ;on their channel

; Dynamic Feature Groups:
;   Dynamic feature groups are groupings of features defined in [applicationmap]
;   that can have their own custom key mappings.  To give a channel access to a dynamic
;   feature group, add the group name to the value of the DYNAMIC_FEATURES variable.
;
; example:
; [myGroupName]         ; defines the group named myGroupName
; testfeature => #9     ; associates testfeature with the group and the keycode '#9'.
; pauseMonitor =>       ; associates pauseMonitor with the group and uses the keycode specified
;                       ; in the [applicationmap].
