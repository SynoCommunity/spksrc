[general]
;
; Global settings for call queues
;
; Persistent Members
;    Store each dynamic member in each queue in the astdb so that
;    when asterisk is restarted, each member will be automatically
;    read into their recorded queues. Default is 'yes'.
;
persistentmembers = yes
;
; AutoFill Behavior
;    The old behavior of the queue (autofill=no) is to have a serial type behavior
;    in that the queue will make all waiting callers wait in the queue
;    even if there is more than one available member ready to take
;    calls until the head caller is connected with the member they
;    were trying to get to. The next waiting caller in line then
;    becomes the head caller, and they are then connected with the
;    next available member and all available members and waiting callers
;    waits while this happens. The new behavior, enabled by setting
;    autofill=yes makes sure that when the waiting callers are connecting
;    with available members in a parallel fashion until there are
;    no more available members or no more waiting callers. This is
;    probably more along the lines of how a queue should work and
;    in most cases, you will want to enable this behavior. If you
;    do not specify or comment out this option, it will default to yes.
;
;autofill = no
;
; Monitor Type
;    By setting monitor-type = MixMonitor, when specifying monitor-format
;    to enable recording of queue member conversations, app_queue will
;    now use the new MixMonitor application instead of Monitor so
;    the concept of "joining/mixing" the in/out files now goes away
;    when this is enabled. You can set the default type for all queues
;    here, and then also change monitor-type for individual queues within
;    queue by using the same configuration parameter within a queue
;    configuration block. If you do not specify or comment out this option,
;    it will default to the old 'Monitor' behavior to keep backward
;    compatibility.
;
monitor-type = MixMonitor
;
; UpdateCDR behavior.
;    This option is implemented to mimic chan_agents behavior of populating
;    CDR dstchannel field of a call with an agent name, which you can set
;    at the login time with AddQueueMember membername parameter.
;
; updatecdr = no

;
; Note that a timeout to fail out of a queue may be passed as part of
; an application call from extensions.conf:
; Queue(queuename,[options],[optionalurl],[announceoverride],[timeout])
; example: Queue(dave,t,,,45)

; shared_lastcall will make the lastcall and calls received be the same in
; members logged in more than one queue.  This is useful to make the queue
; respect the wrapuptime of another queue for a shared member.
; The default value is yes.
;
;shared_lastcall=no
;
;[markq]
;
; A sample call queue
;
; Musicclass sets which music applies for this particular call queue.
; The only class which can override this one is if the MOH class is set
; directly on the channel using Set(CHANNEL(musicclass)=whatever) in the
; dialplan.
;
;musicclass = default
;
; An announcement may be specified which is played for the member as
; soon as they answer a call, typically to indicate to them which queue
; this call should be answered as, so that agents or members who are
; listening to more than one queue can differentiated how they should
; engage the customer
;
;announce = queue-markq
;
; A strategy may be specified.  Valid strategies include:
;
; ringall - ring all available channels until one answers (default)
; leastrecent - ring interface which was least recently hung up by this queue
; fewestcalls - ring the one with fewest completed calls from this queue
; random - ring random interface
; rrmemory - round robin with memory, remember where we left off last ring pass
; rrordered - same as rrmemory, except the queue member order from config file 
;             is preserved
; linear - rings interfaces in the order specified in this configuration file.
;          If you use dynamic members, the members will be rung in the order in
;          which they were added
; wrandom - rings random interface, but uses the member's penalty as a weight
;           when calculating their metric. So a member with penalty 0 will have
;           a metric somewhere between 0 and 1000, and a member with penalty 1 will
;			have a metric between 0 and 2000, and a member with penalty 2 will have
;           a metric between 0 and 3000. Please note, if using this strategy, the member
;           penalty is not the same as when using other queue strategies. It is ONLY used
;           as a weight for calculating metric.
;
;strategy = ringall
;
; Second settings for service level (default 0)
; Used for service level statistics (calls answered within service level time
; frame)
;servicelevel = 60
;
; A context may be specified, in which if the user types a SINGLE
; digit extension while they are in the queue, they will be taken out
; of the queue and sent to that extension in this context.
;
;context = qoutcon
;
; A limit can be set to disregard penalty settings when the queue has
; too few members.  No penalty will be weighed in if there are only X
; or fewer queue members. (default 0)
;
;penaltymemberslimit = 5
;
;----------------------QUEUE TIMING OPTIONS------------------------------------
; A Queue has two different "timeout" values associated with it. One is the
; timeout parameter configured in queues.conf. This timeout specifies the
; amount of time to try ringing a member's phone before considering the
; member to be unavailable. The other timeout value is the second argument
; to the Queue() application. This timeout represents the absolute amount
; of time to allow a caller to stay in the queue before the caller is
; removed from the queue. In certain situations, these two timeout values
; may clash. For instance, if the timeout in queues.conf is set to 5 seconds,
; the retry value in queues.conf is set to 4, and the second argument to Queue()
; is 10, then the following may occur:
;
; A caller places a call to a queue.
; The queue selects a member and attempts to ring that member.
; The member's phone is rung for 5 seconds and he does not answer.
; The retry time of 4 seconds occurs.
; The queue selects a second member to call.
;
; How long does that second member's phone ring? Does it ring for 5 seconds
; since the timeout set in app_queue is 5 seconds? Does it ring for 1 second since
; the caller has been in the queue for 9 seconds and is supposed to be removed after
; being in the queue for 10 seconds? This is configurable with the timeoutpriority
; option. By setting the timeoutpriority to "conf" then you are saying that you would
; rather use the time specified in the configuration file even if it means having the
; caller stay in the queue longer than the time specified in the application argument.
; For the scenario described above, timeoutpriority=conf would result in the second
; member's phone ringing for 5 seconds. By specifying "app" as the value for
; timeoutpriority, you are saying that the timeout specified as the argument to the
; Queue application is more important. In the scenario above, timeoutpriority=app
; would result in the second member's phone ringing for 1 second.
;
; There are a few exceptions to the priority rules. For instance, if timeoutpriority=appp
; and the configuration file timeout is set to 0, but the application argument timeout is
; non-zero, then the timeoutpriority is ignored and the application argument is used as
; the timeout. Furthermore, if no application argument timeout is specified, then the
; timeoutpriority option is ignored and the configuration file timeout is always used
; when calling queue members.
;
; In timeoutpriority=conf mode however timeout specified in config file will take higher
; priority than timeout in application arguments, so if config file has timeout 0, each
; queue member will be called indefineately and application timeout will be checked only
; after this call attempt. This is useful for having queue members with custom timeouts
; specified within Dial application of Local channel, and allows handling NO ANSWER which
; would otherwise be interrupted by queue destroying child channel on timeout.
;
; The default value for timeoutpriority is "app" since this was how previous versions of
; Asterisk behaved.
;
;timeout = 15
;retry = 5

; Valid values are "yes," "no," "limit," or "more." If set to "no," then the caller's position will

; to the caller. If set to "more," then if the number of callers is more than the number
; specified by the announce-position-limit option, then the caller will hear that there
; are more than that many callers waiting (i.e. if a caller number 6 is in a queue with the
; announce-position-limit set to 5, then that caller will hear that there are more than 5
; callers waiting). If set to "limit," then only callers within the limit specified by announce-position-limit
; will have their position announced.
;
;announce-position = yes
;
; If you have specified "limit" or "more" for the announce-position option, then the following

; defaults are as listed below -- change only if you need to.
;
; Keep in mind that you may also prevent a sound from being played if you
; explicitly set a sound to be an empty string. For example, if you want to
; prevent the queue from playing queue-thankyou, you may set the sound using

;periodic-announce = queue-periodic-announce
;
; A set of periodic announcements can be defined by separating
; periodic announcements to reproduce by commas. For example:
;periodic-announce = queue-periodic-announce,your-call-is-important,please-wait
;
; The announcements will be played in the order in which they are defined. After
; playing the last announcement, the announcements begin again from the beginning.
;
; Calls may be recorded using Asterisk's monitor/MixMonitor resource
; This can be enabled from within the Queue application, starting recording
; when the call is actually picked up; thus, only successful calls are
; recorded, and you are not recording while people are listening to MOH.
; To enable monitoring, simply specify "monitor-format";  it will be disabled
; otherwise.
;
; You can specify the monitor filename with by calling
;    Set(MONITOR_FILENAME=foo)
; Otherwise it will use MONITOR_FILENAME=${UNIQUEID}
;
; Pick any one valid extension for monitor format recording. If you leave
; monitor-format commented out, it will not record calls.
;

;
; Monitor Type
;    By setting monitor-type = MixMonitor, when specifying monitor-format
;    to enable recording of queue member conversations, app_queue will

;    when this is enabled. If you do not specify or comment out this option,
;    it will default to the old 'Monitor' behavior to keep backward
;    compatibility.
;
; monitor-type = MixMonitor
;
; ----------------------- TYPE MIXMONITOR OPTIONS -----------------------------
;
;
; You can specify the options supplied to MixMonitor by calling (from the dialplan)
;   Set(MONITOR_OPTIONS=av(<x>)V(<x>)W(<x>))
; The 'b' option for MixMonitor (only save audio to the file while bridged) is
; implied.
;
; You can specify a post recording command to be executed after the end of
; recording by calling (from the dialplan)
;
;   Set(MONITOR_EXEC=mv /var/spool/asterisk/monitor/^{MONITOR_FILENAME} /tmp/^{MONITOR_FILENAME})
;
; or
;
;   Set(MONITOR_EXEC=mv /var/spool/asterisk/monitor/^{MIXMONITOR_FILENAME} /tmp/^{MIXMONITOR_FILENAME})
;
; If you choose to use the latter, you will not be able to switch the monitor-type back to Monitor
; without changing this in the dialplan.
;
;
; The command specified within the contents of MONITOR_EXEC will be executed when
; the recording is over. Any strings matching ^{X} will be unescaped to ${X} and
; all variables will be evaluated just prior to recording being started.
;
; The contents of MONITOR_FILENAME will also be unescaped from ^{X} to ${X} and
; all variables will be evaluated just prior to recording being started.
;
; ---------------------- Queue Empty Options ----------------------------------
;
; Asterisk has provided the "joinempty" and "leavewhenempty" options for a while
; with tenuous definitions of what they actually mean. The "joinempty" option controls
; whether a caller may join a queue depending on several factors of member availability.
; Similarly, then leavewhenempty option controls whether a caller may remain in a queue
; he has already joined. Both options take a comma-separated list of factors which
; contribute towards whether a caller may join/remain in the queue. The list of
; factors which contribute to these option is as follows:
;
; paused: a member is not considered available if he is paused
; penalty: a member is not considered available if his penalty is less than QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY
; inuse: a member is not considered available if he is currently on a call
; ringing: a member is not considered available if his phone is currently ringing
; unavailable: This applies mainly to Agent channels. If the agent is a member of the queue
;              but has not logged in, then do not consider the member to be available
; invalid: Do not consider a member to be available if he has an "invalid" device state.
;          This generally is caused by an error condition in the member's channel driver.
; unknown: Do not consider a member to be available if we are unable to determine the member's
;          current device state.
; wrapup: A member is not considered available if he is currently in his wrapuptime after
;         taking a call.
;
; For the "joinempty" option, when a caller attempts to enter a queue, the members of that
; queue are examined. If all members are deemed to be unavailable due to any of the conditions
; listed for the "joinempty" option, then the caller will be unable to enter the queue. For the
; "leavewhenempty" option, the state of the members of the queue are checked periodically during
; the caller's stay in the queue. If all of the members are unavailable due to any of the above
; conditions, then the caller will be removed from the queue.
;
; Some examples:
;
;joinempty = paused,inuse,invalid
;
; A caller will not be able to enter a queue if at least one member cannot be found
; who is not paused, on the phone, or who has an invalid device state.
;
;leavewhenempty = inuse,ringing
;
; A caller will be removed from the queue if at least one member cannot be found
; who is not on the phone, or whose phone is not ringing.
;
; For the sake of backwards-compatibility, the joinempty and leavewhenempty
; options also accept the strings "yes" "no" "strict" and "loose". The following
; serves as a translation for these values:
;
; yes - (empty) for joinempty; penalty,paused,invalid for leavewhenempty
; no - penalty,paused,invalid for joinempty; (empty) for leavewhenempty
; strict - penalty,paused,invalid,unavailable
; loose - penalty,invalid
;

; If this is set to yes, the following manager events will be generated:
; AgentCalled, AgentDump, AgentConnect, AgentComplete; setting this to
; vars also sends all channel variables with the event.
; (may generate some extra manager events, but probably ones you want)
;
; eventwhencalled = yes|no|vars
;
; If this is set to yes, the following manager events will be generated:
; QueueMemberStatus
; (may generate a WHOLE LOT of extra manager events)
; The default value is yes and this can not be set globally.
;
; eventmemberstatus = no
;
; If you wish to report the caller's hold time to the member before they are
; connected to the caller, set this to yes.
;
; reportholdtime = no
;
; If you want the queue to avoid sending calls to members whose devices are
; known to be 'in use' (via the channel driver supporting that device state)
; uncomment this option. (Note: only the SIP channel driver currently is able
; to report 'in use'.)
;
; ringinuse = no
;
; If you wish to have a delay before the member is connected to the caller (or
; before the member hears any announcement messages), set this to the number of
; seconds to delay.
;
; memberdelay = 0
;
; If timeoutrestart is set to yes, then the timeout for an agent to answer is
; reset if a BUSY or CONGESTION is received.  This can be useful if agents
; are able to cancel a call with reject or similar.
;
; timeoutrestart = no
;
; If you wish to implement a rule defined in queuerules.conf (see
; configs/queuerules.conf.sample from the asterisk source directory for
; more information about penalty rules) by default, you may specify this
; by setting defaultrule to the rule's name
;
; defaultrule = myrule
;
; Each member of this call queue is listed on a separate line in
; the form technology/dialstring.  "member" means a normal member of a
; queue.  An optional penalty may be specified after a comma, such that
; entries with higher penalties are considered last.  An optional member
; name may also be specified after a second comma, which is used in log
; messages as a "friendly name".  Multiple interfaces may share a single
; member name. An optional state interface may be specified after a third
; comma. This interface will be the one for which app_queue receives device
; state notifications, even though the first interface specified is the one
; that is actually called.
;
; A hint can also be used in place of the state interface using the format
; hint:<extension>@<context>. If no context is specified then 'default' will
; be used.
;
; It is important to ensure that channel drivers used for members are loaded
; before app_queue.so itself or they may be marked invalid until reload. This
; can be accomplished by explicitly listing them in modules.conf before
; app_queue.so.  Additionally, if you use Local channels as queue members, you
; must also preload pbx_config.so and chan_local.so (or pbx_ael.so, pbx_lua.so,
; or pbx_realtime.so, depending on how your dialplan is configured).
