;

; You can adjust several parameters relating to the jitter buffer.
; The jitter buffer's function is to compensate for varying
; network delay.
;
; All the jitter buffer settings are in milliseconds.
; The jitter buffer works for INCOMING audio - the outbound audio
; will be dejittered by the jitter buffer at the other end.
;
; jitterbuffer=yes|no: global default as to whether you want
; the jitter buffer at all.
;
; forcejitterbuffer=yes|no: in the ideal world, when we bridge VoIP channels
; we don't want to do jitterbuffering on the switch, since the endpoints
; can each handle this.  However, some endpoints may have poor jitterbuffers
; themselves, so this option will force * to always jitterbuffer, even in this
; case.
;
; maxjitterbuffer: a maximum size for the jitter buffer.
; Setting a reasonable maximum here will prevent the call delay
; from rising to silly values in extreme situations; you'll hear
; SOMETHING, even though it will be jittery.
;
; resyncthreshold: when the jitterbuffer notices a significant change in delay
; that continues over a few frames, it will resync, assuming that the change in
; delay was caused by a timestamping mix-up. The threshold for noticing a
; change in delay is measured as twice the measured jitter plus this resync
; threshold.
; Resyncing can be disabled by setting this parameter to -1.
;
; maxjitterinterps: the maximum number of interpolation frames the jitterbuffer
; should return in a row. Since some clients do not send CNG/DTX frames to
; indicate silence, the jitterbuffer will assume silence has begun after
; returning this many interpolations. This prevents interpolating throughout
; a long silence.
;
;
; jittertargetextra: number of milliseconds by which the new jitter buffer
; will pad its size. the default is 40, so without modification, the new
; jitter buffer will set its size to the jitter value plus 40 milliseconds.
; increasing this value may help if your network normally has low jitter,
; but occasionally has spikes.

;
; Enable IAX2 encryption.  The default is no.
;
; encryption = yes
;
; Force encryption insures no connection is established unless both sides support
; encryption.  By turning this option on, encryption is automatically turned on as well.
;
; forceencryption = yes

; This option defines the maximum payload in bytes an IAX2 trunk can support at a given time.
; The best way to explain this is to provide an example.  If the maximum number of calls
; to be supported is 800, and each call transmits 20ms frames of audio using ulaw
; ((8000hz / 1000ms) * 20ms * 1 byte per sample = 160 bytes per frame), the maximum load
; in bytes is (160 bytes per frame) * (800 calls) = 128000 bytes total. Once this limit is
; reached, calls may be dropped or begin to lose audio.  Depending on the codec in use and
; number of channels to be supported this value may need to be raised, but in most cases the
; default value is large enough.
;
; trunkmaxsize = 128000 ; defaults to 128000 bytes, which supports up to 800 calls of ulaw
;                       ; at 20ms a frame.

; With a large amount of traffic on IAX2 trunks, there is a risk of bad voice quality when
; allowing the Linux system to handle fragmentation of UDP packets. Depending on the size of
; each payload, allowing the O/S to handle fragmentation may not be very efficient. This
; setting sets the maximum transmission unit for IAX2 UDP trunking. The default is 1240 bytes
; which means if a trunk's payload is over 1240 bytes for every 20ms it will be broken into
; multiple 1240 byte messages.  Zero disables this functionality and let's the O/S handle
; fragmentation.
;
; trunkmtu = 1240 ; trunk data will be sent in 1240 byte messages.

; trunkfreq sets how frequently trunk messages are sent in milliseconds. This value is 20ms by
; default, which means the trunk will send all the date queued to it in the past 20ms.  By
; increasing the time between sending trunk messages, the trunk's payload size will increase as
; well.  Note, depending on the size set by trunkmtu, messages may be sent more often than
; specified.  For example if a trunk's message size grows to the trunkmtu size before 20ms is
; reached that message will be sent immediately.  Acceptable values are between 10ms and
; 1000ms.
;
; trunkfreq=20     ; How frequently to send trunk msgs (in ms). This is 20ms by default.

; Should we send timestamps for the individual sub-frames within trunk frames?
; There is a small bandwidth use for these (less than 1kbps/call), but they
; ensure that frame timestamps get sent end-to-end properly.  If both ends of
; all your trunks go directly to TDM, _and_ your trunkfreq equals the frame
; length for your codecs, you can probably suppress these.  The receiver must
; also support this feature, although they do not also need to have it enabled.

;
; Through the use of the res_stun_monitor module, Asterisk has the ability to detect when the
; perceived external network address has changed.  When the stun_monitor is installed and
; configured, chan_iax will renew all outbound registrations when the monitor detects any sort
; of network change has occurred. By default this option is enabled, but only takes effect once
; res_stun_monitor is configured.  If res_stun_monitor is enabled and you wish to not
; generate all outbound registrations on a network change, use the option below to disable
; this feature.

;
; If we don't get ACK to our NEW within 2000ms, and autokill is set to yes,
; then we cancel the whole thing (that's enough time for one retransmission
; only).  This is used to keep things from stalling for a long time for a host
; that is not available, but would be ill advised for bad connections.  In
; addition to 'yes' or 'no' you can also specify a number of milliseconds.

;
; codecpriority controls the codec negotiation of an inbound IAX call.
; This option is inherited to all user entities.  It can also be defined

; caller   - Consider the callers preferred order ahead of the host's.
; host     - Consider the host's preferred order ahead of the caller's.
; disabled - Disable the consideration of codec preference altogether.
;            (this is the original behaviour before preferences were added)
; reqonly  - Same as disabled, only do not consider capabilities if
;            the requested format is not available the call will only
;            be accepted if the requested format is available.

; The default value is 'host'
;
;codecpriority=host
;
; allowfwdownload controls whether this host will serve out firmware to

; and it has been recently proven that this firmware distribution method
; can be used as a source of traffic amplification attacks.  Also, the
; IAXy firmware has not been updated for at least 18 months, so unless
; you are provisioning IAXys in a secure network, we recommend that you
; leave this option to the default, off.

;
; The following two options are used to disable call token validation for the
; purposes of interoperability with IAX2 endpoints that do not yet support it.
;
; Call token validation can be set as optional for a single IP address or IP
; address range by using the 'calltokenoptional' option. 'calltokenoptional' is
; only a global option.  
;
;calltokenoptional=209.16.236.73/255.255.255.0
;
; By setting 'requirecalltoken=no', call token validation becomes optional for
; that peer/user.  By setting 'requirecalltoken=auto', call token validation 
; is optional until a call token supporting peer registers successfully using
; call token validation.  This is used as an indication that from now on, we
; can require it from this peer.  So, requirecalltoken is internally set to yes.
; requirecalltoken may only be used in peer/user/friend definitions,
; not in the global scope.
; By default, 'requirecalltoken=yes'.
;
;requirecalltoken=no
;

;
; These options are used to limit the amount of call numbers allocated to a
; single IP address.  Before changing any of these values, it is highly encouraged
; to read the user guide associated with these options first.  In most cases, the
; default values for these options are sufficient.
;
; The 'maxcallnumbers' option limits the amount of call numbers allowed for each
; individual remote IP address.  Once an IP address reaches it's call number
; limit, no more new connections are allowed until the previous ones close.  This
; option can be used in a peer definition as well, but only takes effect for
; the IP of a dynamic peer after it completes registration.
;
;maxcallnumbers=512
;
; The 'maxcallnumbers_nonvalidated' is used to set the combined number of call
; numbers that can be allocated for connections where call token  validation
; has been disabled.  Unlike the 'maxcallnumbers' option, this limit is not
; separate for each individual IP address.  Any connection resulting in a
; non-call token validated call number being allocated contributes to this
; limit.  For use cases, see the call token user guide.  This option's 
; default value of 8192 should be sufficient in most cases.
;
;maxcallnumbers_nonvalidated=1024
;
; The [callnumberlimits] section allows custom call number limits to be set
; for specific IP addresses and IP address ranges.  These limits take precedence
; over the global 'maxcallnumbers' option, but may still be overridden by a
; peer defined 'maxcallnumbers' entry.  Note that these limits take effect
; for every individual address within the range, not the range as a whole.

; instead of trusting what the remote user provides
;
; There are three authentication methods that are supported:  md5, plaintext,
; and rsa.  The least secure is "plaintext", which sends passwords cleartext
; across the net.  "md5" uses a challenge/response md5 sum arrangement, but
; still requires both ends have plain text access to the secret.  "rsa" allows
; unidirectional secret knowledge through public/private keys.  If "rsa"
; authentication is used, "inkeys" is a list of acceptable public keys on the
; local system that can be used to authenticate the remote peer, separated by
; the ":" character.  "outkey" is a single, private key to use to authenticate
; to the other side.  Public keys are named /var/lib/asterisk/keys/<name>.pub
; while private keys are named /var/lib/asterisk/keys/<name>.key.  Private
; keys should always be 3DES encrypted.
