; SIP Configuration example for Asterisk
;
; Note: Please read the security documentation for Asterisk in order to
; 	understand the risks of installing Asterisk with the sample
;	configuration. If your Asterisk is installed on a public
;	IP address connected to the Internet, you will want to learn
;	about the various security settings BEFORE you start
;	Asterisk. 
;
;	Especially note the following settings:
;		- allowguest (default enabled)
;		- permit/deny - IP address filters
;		- contactpermit/contactdeny - IP address filters for registrations
;		- context - Which set of services you offer various users
;
; SIP dial strings
;-----------------------------------------------------------
; In the dialplan (extensions.conf) you can use several
; syntaxes for dialing SIP devices.
;        SIP/devicename
;        SIP/username@domain   (SIP uri)
;        SIP/username[:password[:md5secret[:authname[:transport]]]]@host[:port]
;        SIP/devicename/extension
;        SIP/devicename/extension/IPorHost
;        SIP/username@domain//IPorHost
;
;
; Devicename
;        devicename is defined as a peer in a section below.
;
; username@domain
;        Call any SIP user on the Internet
;        (Don't forget to enable DNS SRV records if you want to use this)
;
; devicename/extension
;        If you define a SIP proxy as a peer below, you may call
;        SIP/proxyhostname/user or SIP/user@proxyhostname
;        where the proxyhostname is defined in a section below
;        This syntax also works with ATA's with FXO ports
;
; SIP/username[:password[:md5secret[:authname]]]@host[:port]
;        This form allows you to specify password or md5secret and authname
;        without altering any authentication data in config.
;        Examples:
;
;        SIP/*98@mysipproxy
;        SIP/sales:topsecret::account02@domain.com:5062
;        SIP/12345678::bc53f0ba8ceb1ded2b70e05c3f91de4f:myname@192.168.0.1
;
; IPorHost
;        The next server for this call regardless of domain/peer
;
; All of these dial strings specify the SIP request URI.
; In addition, you can specify a specific To: header by adding an
; exclamation mark after the dial string, like
;
;         SIP/sales@mysipproxy!sales@edvina.net
;
; A new feature for 1.8 allows one to specify a host or IP address to use
; when routing the call. This is typically used in tandem with func_srv if
; multiple methods of reaching the same domain exist. The host or IP address
; is specified after the third slash in the dialstring. Examples:
;
; SIP/devicename/extension/IPorHost
; SIP/username@domain//IPorHost
;
; CLI Commands
; -------------------------------------------------------------
; Useful CLI commands to check peers/users:
;   sip show peers               Show all SIP peers (including friends)
;   sip show registry            Show status of hosts we register with
;
;   sip set debug on             Show all SIP messages
;
;   sip reload                   Reload configuration file
;   sip show settings            Show the current channel configuration
;
;------- Naming devices ------------------------------------------------------
;
; When naming devices, make sure you understand how Asterisk matches calls
; that come in.
;	1. Asterisk checks the SIP From: address username and matches against
;	   names of devices with type=user
;	   The name is the text between square brackets [name]
;	2. Asterisk checks the From: addres and matches the list of devices
;	   with a type=peer
;	3. Asterisk checks the IP address (and port number) that the INVITE
;	   was sent from and matches against any devices with type=peer
;
; Don't mix extensions with the names of the devices. Devices need a unique
; name. The device name is *not* used as phone numbers. Phone numbers are
; anything you declare as an extension in the dialplan (extensions.conf).
;
; When setting up trunks, make sure there's no risk that any From: username
; (caller ID) will match any of your device names, because then Asterisk
; might match the wrong device.
;
; Note: The parameter "username" is not the username and in most cases is
;       not needed at all. Check below. In later releases, it's renamed
;       to "defaultuser" which is a better name, since it is used in
;       combination with the "defaultip" setting.
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; ** Old configuration options **
; The "call-limit" configuation option is considered old is replaced
; by new functionality. To enable callcounters, you use the new 
; "callcounter" setting (for extension states in queue and subscriptions)
; You are encouraged to use the dialplan groupcount functionality
; to enforce call limits instead of using this channel-specific method.
; You can still set limits per device in sip.conf or in a database by using
; "setvar" to set variables that can be used in the dialplan for various limits.

[general]
context=default                 ; Default context for incoming calls
;allowguest=no                  ; Allow or reject guest calls (default is yes)
				; If your Asterisk is connected to the Internet
				; and you have allowguest=yes
				; you want to check which services you offer everyone
				; out there, by enabling them in the default context (see below).
;match_auth_username=yes        ; if available, match user entry using the
                                ; 'username' field from the authentication line
                                ; instead of the From: field.
allowoverlap=no                 ; Disable overlap dialing support. (Default is yes)
;allowoverlap=yes               ; Enable RFC3578 overlap dialing support.
                                ; Can use the Incomplete application to collect the
                                ; needed digits from an ambiguous dialplan match.
;allowoverlap=dtmf              ; Enable overlap dialing support using DTMF delivery
                                ; methods (inband, RFC2833, SIP INFO) in the early
                                ; media phase.  Uses the Incomplete application to
                                ; collect the needed digits.
;allowtransfer=no               ; Disable all transfers (unless enabled in peers or users)
                                ; Default is enabled. The Dial() options 't' and 'T' are not
                                ; related as to whether SIP transfers are allowed or not.
;realm=mydomain.tld             ; Realm for digest authentication
                                ; defaults to "asterisk". If you set a system name in
                                ; asterisk.conf, it defaults to that system name
                                ; Realms MUST be globally unique according to RFC 3261
                                ; Set this to your host name or domain name
;domainsasrealm=no              ; Use domains list as realms
                                ; You can serve multiple Realms specifying several
                                ; 'domain=...' directives (see below). 
                                ; In this case Realm will be based on request 'From'/'To' header
                                ; and should match one of domain names.
                                ; Otherwise default 'realm=...' will be used.

; With the current situation, you can do one of four things:
;  a) Listen on a specific IPv4 address.      Example: bindaddr=192.0.2.1
;  b) Listen on a specific IPv6 address.      Example: bindaddr=2001:db8::1
;  c) Listen on the IPv4 wildcard.            Example: bindaddr=0.0.0.0
;  d) Listen on the IPv4 and IPv6 wildcards.  Example: bindaddr=::
; (You can choose independently for UDP, TCP, and TLS, by specifying different values for
; "udpbindaddr", "tcpbindaddr", and "tlsbindaddr".)
; (Note that using bindaddr=:: will show only a single IPv6 socket in netstat.
;  IPv4 is supported at the same time using IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.)
;
; Using bindaddr will only enable UDP support in order to be backwards compatible with those systems
; that were upgraded prior to TCP support. Use udpbindaddr and tcpbindaddr to bind to UDP and TCP
; independently.
;
; You may optionally add a port number. (The default is port 5060 for UDP and TCP, 5061
; for TLS).
;   IPv4 example: bindaddr=0.0.0.0:5062
;   IPv6 example: bindaddr=[::]:5062
;
; The address family of the bound UDP address is used to determine how Asterisk performs
; DNS lookups. In cases a) and c) above, only A records are considered. In case b), only
; AAAA records are considered. In case d), both A and AAAA records are considered. Note,
; however, that Asterisk ignores all records except the first one. In case d), when both A
; and AAAA records are available, either an A or AAAA record will be first, and which one
; depends on the operating system. On systems using glibc, AAAA records are given
; priority.

udpbindaddr=0.0.0.0             ; IP address to bind UDP listen socket to (0.0.0.0 binds to all)
                                ; Optionally add a port number, 192.168.1.1:5062 (default is port 5060)

; When a dialog is started with another SIP endpoint, the other endpoint
; should include an Allow header telling us what SIP methods the endpoint
; implements. However, some endpoints either do not include an Allow header
; or lie about what methods they implement. In the former case, Asterisk
; makes the assumption that the endpoint supports all known SIP methods.
; If you know that your SIP endpoint does not provide support for a specific
; method, then you may provide a comma-separated list of methods that your
; endpoint does not implement in the disallowed_methods option. Note that 
; if your endpoint is truthful with its Allow header, then there is no need 
; to set this option. This option may be set in the general section or may
; be set per endpoint. If this option is set both in the general section and
; in a peer section, then the peer setting completely overrides the general
; setting (i.e. the result is *not* the union of the two options).
;
; Note also that while Asterisk currently will parse an Allow header to learn
; what methods an endpoint supports, the only actual use for this currently
; is for determining if Asterisk may send connected line UPDATE requests and
; MESSAGE requests. Its use may be expanded in the future.
;
; disallowed_methods = UPDATE

;
; Note that the TCP and TLS support for chan_sip is currently considered
; experimental.  Since it is new, all of the related configuration options are
; subject to change in any release.  If they are changed, the changes will
; be reflected in this sample configuration file, as well as in the UPGRADE.txt file.

; is sending.

; The default for Timer T1 is 500 ms or the measured run-trip time between
; Asterisk and the device if you have qualify=yes for the device.
;

;--------------------------- SIP Session-Timers (RFC 4028)------------------------------------
; SIP Session-Timers provide an end-to-end keep-alive mechanism for active SIP sessions.
; This mechanism can detect and reclaim SIP channels that do not terminate through normal
; signaling procedures. Session-Timers can be configured globally or at a user/peer level.
; The operation of Session-Timers is driven by the following configuration parameters:
;
; * session-timers    - Session-Timers feature operates in the following three modes:
;                            originate : Request and run session-timers always
;                            accept    : Run session-timers only when requested by other UA
;                            refuse    : Do not run session timers in any case
;                       The default mode of operation is 'accept'.
; * session-expires   - Maximum session refresh interval in seconds. Defaults to 1800 secs.
; * session-minse     - Minimum session refresh interval in seconds. Defualts to 90 secs.
; * session-refresher - The session refresher (uac|uas). Defaults to 'uas'.
;
;session-timers=originate
;session-expires=600
;session-minse=90
;session-refresher=uas
;
;--------------------------- SIP DEBUGGING ---------------------------------------------------
;sipdebug = yes                 ; Turn on SIP debugging by default, from
                                ; the moment the channel loads this configuration

                                ; SIP history is output to the DEBUG logging channel


;--------------------------- STATUS NOTIFICATIONS (SUBSCRIPTIONS) ----------------------------
; You can subscribe to the status of extensions with a "hint" priority
; (See extensions.conf.sample for examples)
; chan_sip support two major formats for notifications: dialog-info and SIMPLE
;
; You will get more detailed reports (busy etc) if you have a call counter enabled
; for a device.
;
; If you set the busylevel, we will indicate busy when we have a number of calls that
; matches the busylevel treshold.
;
; For queues, you will need this level of detail in status reporting, regardless
; if you use SIP subscriptions. Queues and manager use the same internal interface
; for reading status information.
;
; Note: Subscriptions does not work if you have a realtime dialplan and use the
; realtime switch.
;
;allowsubscribe=no              ; Disable support for subscriptions. (Default is yes)

                                ; Turning on notifyringing and notifyhold will add a lot

;notifycid = yes                ; Control whether caller ID information is sent along with
                                ; dialog-info+xml notifications (supported by snom phones).
                                ; Note that this feature will only work properly when the
                                ; incoming call is using the same extension and context that
                                ; is being used as the hint for the called extension.  This means
                                ; that it won't work when using subscribecontext for your sip
                                ; user or peer (if subscribecontext is different than context).
                                ; This is also limited to a single caller, meaning that if an
                                ; extension is ringing because multiple calls are incoming,
                                ; only one will be used as the source of caller ID.  Specify
                                ; 'ignore-context' to ignore the called context when looking
                                ; for the caller's channel.  The default value is 'no.' Setting
                                ; notifycid to 'ignore-context' also causes call-pickups attempted
                                ; via SNOM's NOTIFY mechanism to set the context for the call pickup
                                ; to PICKUPMARK.
;callcounter = yes              ; Enable call counters on devices. This can be set per
                                ; device too.

;----------------------------------------- T.38 FAX SUPPORT ----------------------------------
;
; This setting is available in the [general] section as well as in device configurations.
; Setting this to yes enables T.38 FAX (UDPTL) on SIP calls; it defaults to off.
;
; t38pt_udptl = yes            ; Enables T.38 with FEC error correction.
; t38pt_udptl = yes,fec        ; Enables T.38 with FEC error correction.
; t38pt_udptl = yes,redundancy ; Enables T.38 with redundancy error correction.
; t38pt_udptl = yes,none       ; Enables T.38 with no error correction.
;
; In some cases, T.38 endpoints will provide a T38FaxMaxDatagram value (during T.38 setup) that
; is based on an incorrect interpretation of the T.38 recommendation, and results in failures
; because Asterisk does not believe it can send T.38 packets of a reasonable size to that
; endpoint (Cisco media gateways are one example of this situation). In these cases, during a
; T.38 call you will see warning messages on the console/in the logs from the Asterisk UDPTL
; stack complaining about lack of buffer space to send T.38 FAX packets. If this occurs, you
; can set an override (globally, or on a per-device basis) to make Asterisk ignore the
; T38FaxMaxDatagram value specified by the other endpoint, and use a configured value instead.
; This can be done by appending 'maxdatagram=<value>' to the t38pt_udptl configuration option,
; like this:
;
; t38pt_udptl = yes,fec,maxdatagram=400 ; Enables T.38 with FEC error correction and overrides
;                                       ; the other endpoint's provided value to assume we can
;                                       ; send 400 byte T.38 FAX packets to it.
;
; FAX detection will cause the SIP channel to jump to the 'fax' extension (if it exists)
; based one or more events being detected. The events that can be detected are an incoming
; CNG tone or an incoming T.38 re-INVITE request.
;
; faxdetect = yes		; Default 'no', 'yes' enables both CNG and T.38 detection
; faxdetect = cng		; Enables only CNG detection
; faxdetect = t38		; Enables only T.38 detection
;
;----------------------------------------- OUTBOUND SIP REGISTRATIONS  ------------------------
; Asterisk can register as a SIP user agent to a SIP proxy (provider)
; Format for the register statement is:
;       register => [peer?][transport://]user[@domain][:secret[:authuser]]@host[:port][/extension][~expiry]
;
;
;
; domain is either
;	- domain in DNS
; 	- host name in DNS
;	- the name of a peer defined below or in realtime
; The domain is where you register your username, so your SIP uri you are registering to
; is username@domain
;
; If no extension is given, the 's' extension is used. The extension needs to
; be defined in extensions.conf to be able to accept calls from this SIP proxy
; (provider).
;
; A similar effect can be achieved by adding a "callbackextension" option in a peer section.
; this is equivalent to having the following line in the general section:
;
;        register => username:secret@host/callbackextension
;
; and more readable because you don't have to write the parameters in two places
; (note that the "port" is ignored - this is a bug that should be fixed).
;
; Note that a register= line doesn't mean that we will match the incoming call in any
; other way than described above. If you want to control where the call enters your
; dialplan, which context, you want to define a peer with the hostname of the provider's
; server. If the provider has multiple servers to place calls to your system, you need
; a peer for each server.
;
; Beginning with Asterisk version 1.6.2, the "user" portion of the register line may
; contain a port number. Since the logical separator between a host and port number is a
; ':' character, and this character is already used to separate between the optional "secret"
; and "authuser" portions of the line, there is a bit of a hoop to jump through if you wish
; to use a port here. That is, you must explicitly provide a "secret" and "authuser" even if
; they are blank. See the third example below for an illustration.
;
;
; Examples:
;
;register => 1234:password@mysipprovider.com
;
;     This will pass incoming calls to the 's' extension
;
;
;register => 2345:password@sip_proxy/1234
;
;    Register 2345 at sip provider 'sip_proxy'.  Calls from this provider
;    connect to local extension 1234 in extensions.conf, default context,
;    unless you configure a [sip_proxy] section below, and configure a
;    context.
;    Tip 1: Avoid assigning hostname to a sip.conf section like [provider.com]
;    Tip 2: Use separate inbound and outbound sections for SIP providers
;           (instead of type=friend) if you have calls in both directions
;
;register => 3456@mydomain:5082::@mysipprovider.com
;
;    Note that in this example, the optional authuser and secret portions have
;    been left blank because we have specified a port in the user section
;
;register => tls://username:xxxxxx@sip-tls-proxy.example.org
;
;    The 'transport' part defaults to 'udp' but may also be 'tcp' or 'tls'.
;    Using 'udp://' explicitly is also useful in case the username part
;    contains a '/' ('user/name').

;registertimeout=20             ; retry registration calls every 20 seconds (default)
;registerattempts=10            ; Number of registration attempts before we give up
                                ; 0 = continue forever, hammering the other server
                                ; until it accepts the registration
                                ; Default is 0 tries, continue forever

;----------------------------------------- OUTBOUND MWI SUBSCRIPTIONS -------------------------
; Asterisk can subscribe to receive the MWI from another SIP server and store it locally for retrieval
; by other phones. At this time, you can only subscribe using UDP as the transport.
; Format for the mwi register statement is:
;       mwi => user[:secret[:authuser]]@host[:port]/mailbox
;
; Examples:
;mwi => 1234:password@mysipprovider.com/1234
;mwi => 1234:password@myportprovider.com:6969/1234
;mwi => 1234:password:authuser@myauthprovider.com/1234
;mwi => 1234:password:authuser@myauthportprovider.com:6969/1234
;
; MWI received will be stored in the 1234 mailbox of the SIP_Remote context. It can be used by other phones by following the below:
; mailbox=1234@SIP_Remote
;----------------------------------------- NAT SUPPORT ------------------------
;
; WARNING: SIP operation behind a NAT is tricky and you really need
; to read and understand well the following section.
;
; When Asterisk is behind a NAT device, the "local" address (and port) that
; a socket is bound to has different values when seen from the inside or
; from the outside of the NATted network. Unfortunately this address must
; be communicated to the outside (e.g. in SIP and SDP messages), and in
; order to determine the correct value Asterisk needs to know:
;
; + whether it is talking to someone "inside" or "outside" of the NATted network.
;   This is configured by assigning the "localnet" parameter with a list
;   of network addresses that are considered "inside" of the NATted network.
;   IF LOCALNET IS NOT SET, THE EXTERNAL ADDRESS WILL NOT BE SET CORRECTLY.
;   Multiple entries are allowed, e.g. a reasonable set is the following:
;
;      localnet=192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0 ; RFC 1918 addresses
;      localnet=10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0      ; Also RFC1918
;      localnet=172.16.0.0/12           ; Another RFC1918 with CIDR notation
;      localnet=169.254.0.0/255.255.0.0 ; Zero conf local network
;
; + the "externally visible" address and port number to be used when talking
;   to a host outside the NAT. This information is derived by one of the
;   following (mutually exclusive) config file parameters:
;
;   a. "externaddr = hostname[:port]" specifies a static address[:port] to
;      be used in SIP and SDP messages.
;      The hostname is looked up only once, when [re]loading sip.conf .
;      If a port number is not present, use the port specified in the "udpbindaddr"
;      (which is not guaranteed to work correctly, because a NAT box might remap the
;      port number as well as the address).
;      This approach can be useful if you have a NAT device where you can
;      configure the mapping statically. Examples:
;
;        externaddr = 12.34.56.78          ; use this address.
;        externaddr = 12.34.56.78:9900     ; use this address and port.
;        externaddr = mynat.my.org:12600   ; Public address of my nat box.
;        externtcpport = 9900   ; The externally mapped tcp port, when Asterisk is behind a static NAT or PAT. 
;                               ; externtcpport will default to the externaddr or externhost port if either one is set. 
;        externtlsport = 12600  ; The externally mapped tls port, when Asterisk is behind a static NAT or PAT.
;                               ; externtlsport port will default to the RFC designated port of 5061.	
;
;   b. "externhost = hostname[:port]" is similar to "externaddr" except
;      that the hostname is looked up every "externrefresh" seconds
;      (default 10s). This can be useful when your NAT device lets you choose
;      the port mapping, but the IP address is dynamic.
;      Beware, you might suffer from service disruption when the name server
;      resolution fails. Examples:
;
;        externhost=foo.dyndns.net       ; refreshed periodically
;        externrefresh=180               ; change the refresh interval
;
;   Note that at the moment all these mechanism work only for the SIP socket.
;   The IP address discovered with externaddr/externhost is reused for
;   media sessions as well, but the port numbers are not remapped so you
;   may still experience problems.
;
; NOTE 1: in some cases, NAT boxes will use different port numbers in
; the internal<->external mapping. In these cases, the "externaddr" and
; "externhost" might not help you configure addresses properly.
;
; NOTE 2: when using "externaddr" or "externhost", the address part is
; also used as the external address for media sessions. Thus, the port
; information in the SDP may be wrong!
;
; In addition to the above, Asterisk has an additional "nat" parameter to
; address NAT-related issues in incoming SIP or media sessions.
; In particular, depending on the 'nat= ' settings described below, Asterisk
; may override the address/port information specified in the SIP/SDP messages,
; and use the information (sender address) supplied by the network stack instead.
; However, this is only useful if the external traffic can reach us.
; The following settings are allowed (both globally and in individual sections):
;
;        nat = no                ; Use rport if the remote side says to use it.
;        nat = force_rport       ; Force rport to always be on. (default)
;        nat = yes               ; Force rport to always be on and perform comedia RTP handling.
;        nat = comedia           ; Use rport if the remote side says to use it and perform comedia RTP handling.
;
; 'comedia RTP handling' refers to the technique of sending RTP to the port that the
; the other endpoint's RTP arrived from, and means 'connection-oriented media'. This is
; only partially related to RFC 4145 which was referred to as COMEDIA while it was in
; draft form. This method is used to accomodate endpoints that may be located behind
; NAT devices, and as such the port number they tell Asterisk to send RTP packets to
; for their media streams is not actual port number that will be used on the nearer
; side of the NAT.
;
; IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE that if the nat setting in the general section differs from
; the nat setting in a peer definition, then the peer username will be discoverable
; by outside parties as Asterisk will respond to different ports for defined and
; undefined peers. For this reason it is recommended to ONLY DEFINE NAT SETTINGS IN THE
; GENERAL SECTION. Specifically, if nat=force_rport in one section and nat=no in the
; other, then valid peers with settings differing from those in the general section will
; be discoverable.
;
; In addition to these settings, Asterisk *always* uses 'symmetric RTP' mode as defined by
; RFC 4961; Asterisk will always send RTP packets from the same port number it expects
; to receive them on.
;
; The IP address used for media (audio, video, and text) in the SDP can also be overridden by using
; the media_address configuration option. This is only applicable to the general section and
; can not be set per-user or per-peer.
;
; media_address = 172.16.42.1
;
; Through the use of the res_stun_monitor module, Asterisk has the ability to detect when the
; perceived external network address has changed.  When the stun_monitor is installed and
; configured, chan_sip will renew all outbound registrations when the monitor detects any sort
; of network change has occurred. By default this option is enabled, but only takes effect once
; res_stun_monitor is configured.  If res_stun_monitor is enabled and you wish to not
; generate all outbound registrations on a network change, use the option below to disable
; this feature.
;
; subscribe_network_change_event = yes ; on by default

;----------------------------------- MEDIA HANDLING --------------------------------
; By default, Asterisk tries to re-invite media streams to an optimal path. If there's
; no reason for Asterisk to stay in the media path, the media will be redirected.
; This does not really work well in the case where Asterisk is outside and the
; clients are on the inside of a NAT. In that case, you want to set directmedia=nonat.
;
;directmedia=yes                ; Asterisk by default tries to redirect the
                                ; RTP media stream to go directly from
                                ; the caller to the callee.  Some devices do not
                                ; support this (especially if one of them is behind a NAT).
                                ; The default setting is YES. If you have all clients
                                ; behind a NAT, or for some other reason want Asterisk to
                                ; stay in the audio path, you may want to turn this off.

                                ; This setting also affect direct RTP
                                ; at call setup (a new feature in 1.4 - setting up the
                                ; call directly between the endpoints instead of sending
                                ; a re-INVITE).

                                ; Additionally this option does not disable all reINVITE operations.
                                ; It only controls Asterisk generating reINVITEs for the specific
                                ; purpose of setting up a direct media path. If a reINVITE is
                                ; needed to switch a media stream to inactive (when placed on
                                ; hold) or to T.38, it will still be done, regardless of this 
                                ; setting. Note that direct T.38 is not supported.

;directmedia=nonat              ; An additional option is to allow media path redirection
                                ; (reinvite) but only when the peer where the media is being
                                ; sent is known to not be behind a NAT (as the RTP core can
                                ; determine it based on the apparent IP address the media
                                ; arrives from).

;directmedia=update             ; Yet a third option... use UPDATE for media path redirection,
                                ; instead of INVITE. This can be combined with 'nonat', as
                                ; 'directmedia=update,nonat'. It implies 'yes'.

;directrtpsetup=yes             ; Enable the new experimental direct RTP setup. This sets up

;----------------------------------------- SIP DOMAIN SUPPORT ------------------------
; Incoming INVITE and REFER messages can be matched against a list of 'allowed'
; domains, each of which can direct the call to a specific context if desired.
; By default, all domains are accepted and sent to the default context or the
; context associated with the user/peer placing the call.
; REGISTER to non-local domains will be automatically denied if a domain
; list is configured.
;
; Domains can be specified using:
; domain=<domain>[,<context>]
; Examples:
; domain=myasterisk.dom
; domain=customer.com,customer-context
;
; In addition, all the 'default' domains associated with a server should be
; added if incoming request filtering is desired.
; autodomain=yes
;
; To disallow requests for domains not serviced by this server:
; allowexternaldomains=no

[authentication]
; Global credentials for outbound calls, i.e. when a proxy challenges your
; Asterisk server for authentication. These credentials override
; any credentials in peer/register definition if realm is matched.
;
; This way, Asterisk can authenticate for outbound calls to other
; realms. We match realm on the proxy challenge and pick an set of
; credentials from this list
; Syntax:
;        auth = <user>:<secret>@<realm>
;        auth = <user>#<md5secret>@<realm>
; Example:
;auth=mark:topsecret@digium.com
;
; You may also add auth= statements to [peer] definitions
; Peer auth= override all other authentication settings if we match on realm

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; DEVICE CONFIGURATION
;
; SIP entities have a 'type' which determines their roles within Asterisk.
; * For entities with 'type=peer':
;   Peers handle both inbound and outbound calls and are matched by ip/port, so for
;   The case of incoming calls from the peer, the IP address must match in order for
;   The invitation to work. This means calls made from either direction won't work if
;   The peer is unregistered while host=dynamic or if the host is otherise not set to
;   the correct IP of the sender.
; * For entities with 'type=user':
;   Asterisk users handle inbound calls only (meaning they call Asterisk, Asterisk can't
;   call them) and are matched by their authorization information (authname and secret).
;   Asterisk doesn't rely on their IP and will accept calls regardless of the host setting
;   as long as the incoming SIP invite authorizes successfully.
; * For entities with 'type=friend':
;   Asterisk will create the entity as both a friend and a peer. Asterisk will accept
;   calls from friends like it would for users, requiring only that the authorization
;   matches rather than the IP address. Since it is also a peer, a friend entity can
;   be called as long as its IP is known to Asterisk. In the case of host=dynamic,
;   this means it is necessary for the entity to register before Asterisk can call it.
; 
; Use remotesecret for outbound authentication, and secret for authenticating
; inbound requests. For historical reasons, if no remotesecret is supplied for an
; outbound registration or call, the secret will be used. 
;
; For device names, we recommend using only a-z, numerics (0-9) and underscore
;
; For local phones, type=friend works most of the time
;
; If you have one-way audio, you probably have NAT problems.
; If Asterisk is on a public IP, and the phone is inside of a NAT device
; you will need to configure nat option for those phones.
; Also, turn on qualify=yes to keep the nat session open
