; ENV is a global set of environmental variables that will get set.
; Note that all environmental variables can be seen by all connections,
; so you can't have different values for different connections.
[ENV]
;INFORMIXSERVER => my_special_database
;INFORMIXDIR => /opt/informix
;ORACLE_HOME => /home/oracle

; All other sections are arbitrary names for database connections.

;
; The context name is what will be used in other configuration files, such
; as extconfig.conf and func_odbc.conf, to reference this connection.

;
; Permit disabling sections without needing to comment them out.
; If not specified, it is assumed the section is enabled.
enabled => no
;
; This value should match an entry in /etc/odbc.ini
; (or /usr/local/etc/odbc.ini, on FreeBSD and similar systems).
dsn => asterisk
;
; Username for connecting to the database.  The default user is "root".
;username => myuser
;
; Password for authenticating the user to the database.  The default
; password is blank.
;password => mypass
;
; Build a connection at startup?
pre-connect => yes
;
; What should we execute to ensure that our connection is still alive?  The
; statement should return a non-zero value in the first field of its first
; record.  The default is "select 1".
;sanitysql => select 1
;
; On some databases, the connection times out and a reconnection will be
; necessary.  This setting configures the amount of time a connection
; may sit idle (in seconds) before a reconnection will be attempted.
;idlecheck => 3600
;
; Should we use a single connection for all queries?  Most databases will
; allow sharing the connection, though Sybase and MS SQL Server will not.
;share_connections => yes
;
; If we aren't sharing connections, what is the maximum number of connections
; that we should attempt?
;limit => 5
;
; When the channel is destroyed, should any uncommitted open transactions
; automatically be committed?
;forcecommit => no
;
; How should we perceive data in other transactions within the database?
; Possible values are read_uncommitted, read_committed, repeatable_read,
; and serializable.  The default is read_committed.
;isolation => repeatable_read
;
; Is the backslash a native escape character?  The default is yes, but for
; MS SQL Server, the answer is no.
;backslash_is_escape => yes
;
; How long (in seconds) should we attempt to connect before considering the
; connection dead?  The default is 10 seconds, but you may wish to reduce it,
; to increase responsiveness.
;connect_timeout => 10
;
; When a connection fails, how long (in seconds) should we cache that
; information before we attempt another connection?  This increases
; responsiveness, when a database resource is not working.
;negative_connection_cache => 300
