[general]
; Formats for writing Voicemail.  Note that when using IMAP storage for
; voicemail, only the first format specified will be used.
;format=g723sf|wav49|wav
format=wav49|gsm|wav
;
; WARNING:
; If you change the list of formats that you record voicemail in
; when you have mailboxes that contain messages, you _MUST_ absolutely
; manually go through those mailboxes and convert/delete/add the
; the message files so that they appear to have been stored using
; your new format list. If you don't do this, very unpleasant
; things may happen to your users while they are retrieving and
; manipulating their voicemail.
;
; In other words: don't change the format list on a production system
; unless you are _VERY_  sure that you know what you are doing and are
; prepared for the consequences.
;
; Who the e-mail notification should appear to come from
serveremail=asterisk
;serveremail=asterisk@linux-support.net
; Should the email contain the voicemail as an attachment
attach=yes
; Maximum number of messages per folder.  If not specified, a default value
; (100) is used.  Maximum value for this option is 9999.  If set to 0, a
; mailbox will be greetings-only.
;maxmsg=100
; Maximum length of a voicemail message in seconds
;maxsecs=180
; Minimum length of a voicemail message in seconds for the message to be kept
; The default is no minimum.
;minsecs=3
; Maximum length of greetings in seconds
;maxgreet=60
; How many milliseconds to skip forward/back when rew/ff in message playback
skipms=3000
; How many seconds of silence before we end the recording
maxsilence=10
; Silence threshold (what we consider silence: the lower, the more sensitive)
silencethreshold=128
; Max number of failed login attempts
maxlogins=3
;
; Move heard messages to the 'Old' folder automagically.  Defaults to on.
;moveheard=yes
;
; Forward an urgent message as an urgent message.  Defaults to no so
; sender can set the urgency on the envelope of the forwarded message.
;forward_urgent_auto=no
;
; User context is where entries from users.conf are registered.  The
; default value is 'default'
;
;userscontext=default
;
; If you need to have an external program, i.e. /usr/bin/myapp
; called when a voicemail is left, delivered, or your voicemailbox
; is checked, uncomment this.
;externnotify=/usr/bin/myapp

; If you would also like to enable SMDI notification then set smdienable to yes.
; You will also need to make sure smdiport is set to a valid port as specified in
; smdi.conf.
;smdienable=yes
;smdiport=/dev/ttyS0

; If you need to have an external program, i.e. /usr/bin/myapp
; called when a voicemail password is changed, uncomment this. The
; arguments passed to the application are: <context> <mailbox> <newpassword>
; Note: If this is set, the password will NOT be changed in voicemail.conf
; If you would like to also change the password in voicemail.conf, use
; the externpassnotify option below instead.
;externpass=/usr/bin/myapp
;externpassnotify=/usr/bin/myapp

; If you would like to have an external program called when a user changes the
; voicemail password for the purpose of doing validation on the new password,
; then use this option.  The script can decide whether or not the new password
; meets minimum password strength requirements before the Voicemail application
; accepts the password.  If the script decides that the password is not acceptable,
; the user will be informed that the new password does not meet minimum password
; requirements, and they will be asked to enter another password.
;
; The arguments passed to this script are <mailbox> <context> <old pw> <new pw>.
;
; The script should print "VALID" to stdout to indicate that the new password
; is acceptable.  If the password is considered too weak, the script should print
; "INVALID" to stdout.
;
; There is an example script in the contrib/scripts/ directory, voicemailpwcheck.py,
; which implements some basic password checking, and can be used as a starting point
; for use with this option.
;
;externpasscheck=/usr/local/bin/voicemailpwcheck.py

; For the directory, you can override the intro file if you want
;directoryintro=dir-intro
; The character set for voicemail messages can be specified here
; default: ISO-8859-1
;charset=UTF-8
; The ADSI feature descriptor number to download to
;adsifdn=0000000F
; The ADSI security lock code
;adsisec=9BDBF7AC
; The ADSI voicemail application version number.
;adsiver=1
; Skip the "[PBX]:" string from the message title
;pbxskip=yes
; Change the From: string
;fromstring=The Asterisk PBX
; Permit finding entries for forward/compose from the directory
;usedirectory=yes
; Voicemail can be stored in a database using the ODBC driver.
; The value of odbcstorage is the database connection configured
; in res_odbc.conf.
;odbcstorage=asterisk
; The default table for ODBC voicemail storage is voicemessages.
;odbctable=voicemessages
;
; Change the from, body and/or subject, variables:
;     VM_NAME, VM_DUR, VM_MSGNUM, VM_MAILBOX, VM_CALLERID, VM_CIDNUM,
;     VM_CIDNAME, VM_DATE
; Additionally, on forwarded messages, you have the variables:
;     ORIG_VM_CALLERID, ORIG_VM_CIDNUM, ORIG_VM_CIDNAME, ORIG_VM_DATE
; You can select between two variables by using dialplan functions, e.g.
;     ${IF(${ISNULL(${ORIG_VM_DATE})}?${VM_DATE}:${ORIG_VM_DATE})}
;
; Note: The emailbody config row can only be up to 512 characters due to a
;       limitation in the Asterisk configuration subsystem.
;emailsubject=[PBX]: New message ${VM_MSGNUM} in mailbox ${VM_MAILBOX}
; The following definition is very close to the default, but the default shows
; just the CIDNAME, if it is not null, otherwise just the CIDNUM, or "an unknown
; caller", if they are both null.
;emailbody=Dear ${VM_NAME}:\n\n\tjust wanted to let you know you were just left a ${VM_DUR} long message (number ${VM_MSGNUM})\nin mailbox ${VM_MAILBOX} from ${VM_CALLERID}, on ${VM_DATE}, so you might\nwant to check it when you get a chance.  Thanks!\n\n\t\t\t\t--Asterisk\n
;
; Note: ${IF()} strips spacing at the beginning and end of its true and false
; values, so a newline cannot be placed at either location.  The word 'so' is
; therefore duplicated, in order for the newline to be interpreted correctly.
;emailbody=Dear ${VM_NAME}:\n\n\tjust wanted to let you know you were just ${IF($["${VM_CIDNUM}" = "${ORIG_VM_CIDNUM}"]?left:forwarded)} a ${VM_DUR} long message (number ${VM_MSGNUM})\nin mailbox ${VM_MAILBOX} from ${VM_CALLERID}, on ${VM_DATE},\n${IF($["${VM_CIDNUM}" = "${ORIG_VM_CIDNUM}"]?so:(originally sent by ${ORIG_VM_CALLERID} on ${ORIG_VM_DATE})\nso)} you might want to check it when you get a chance.  Thanks!\n\n\t\t\t\t--Asterisk\n
;
; You can also change the Pager From: string, the pager body and/or subject.
; The above defined variables also can be used here
;pagerfromstring=The Asterisk PBX
;pagersubject=New VM
;pagerbody=New ${VM_DUR} long msg in box ${VM_MAILBOX}\nfrom ${VM_CALLERID}, on ${VM_DATE}
;

;
;pollmailboxes=no    ;   If mailboxes are changed anywhere outside of app_voicemail,
;                    ; then this option must be enabled for MWI to work.  This
;                    ; enables polling mailboxes for changes.  Normally, it will
;                    ; expect that changes are only made when someone called in
;                    ; to one of the voicemail applications.
;                    ;   Examples of situations that would require this option are

;                    ; of using IMAP storage.

; If using IMAP storage, specify whether voicemail greetings should be stored
; via IMAP. If no, then greetings are stored as if IMAP storage were not enabled
;imapgreetings=no
; If imapgreetings=yes, then specify which folder to store your greetings in. If
; you do not specify a folder, then INBOX will be used
;greetingsfolder=INBOX
; Some IMAP server implementations store folders under INBOX instead of
; using a top level folder (ex. INBOX/Friends).  In this case, user
; imapparentfolder to set the parent folder. For example, Cyrus IMAP does
; NOT use INBOX as the parent. Default is to have no parent folder set.
;imapparentfolder=INBOX
;
;
;
; Each mailbox is listed in the form <mailbox>=<password>,<name>,<email>,<pager_email>,<options>
; if the e-mail is specified, a message will be sent when a message is
