; ---- General Options ----------------
[general]

;attemptcallerid=no         ; Attempt CallerID handling.  The default value for this
                            ; is "no" because CallerID handling with an SLA setup is
                            ; known to not work properly in some situations.  However,
                            ; feel free to enable it if you would like.  If you do, and
                            ; you find problems, please do not report them.

; ---- Trunk Declarations -------------

;type=trunk                 ; This line is what marks this entry as a trunk.

;device=DAHDI/3             ; Map this trunk declaration to a specific device.

                            ;       DAHDI channels can be directly used.  IP trunks
                            ;       require some indirect configuration which is
                            ;       described in 
                            ; https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/SLA+Trunk+Configuration

;autocontext=line1          ; This supports automatic generation of the dialplan entries
                            ; if the autocontext option is used.  Each trunk should have
                            ; a unique context name.  Then, in chan_dahdi.conf, this device
                            ; should be configured to have incoming calls go to this context.

;ringtimeout=30             ; Set how long to allow this trunk to ring on an inbound call before hanging
                            ; it up as an unanswered call.  The value is in seconds.

;barge=no                   ; If this option is set to "no", then no station will be
                            ; allowed to join a call that is in progress.  The default
                            ; value is "yes".

;hold=private               ; This option configure hold permissions for this trunk.
                            ;   "open"    - This means that any station can put this trunk
                            ;               on hold, and any station can retrieve it from
                            ;               hold.  This is the default.
                            ;   "private" - This means that once a station puts the
                            ;               trunk on hold, no other station will be
                            ;               allowed to retrieve the call from hold.

;autocontext=sla_stations   ; This supports automatic generation of the dialplan entries if
                            ; the autocontext option is used.  All stations can use the same
                            ; context without conflict.  The device for this station should
                            ; have its context configured to the same one listed here.

;ringtimeout=10             ; Set a timeout for how long to allow the station to ring for an
                            ; incoming call, in seconds.

;hold=private               ; This option configure hold permissions for this station.  Note
                            ; that if private hold is set in the trunk entry, that will override
                            ; anything here.  However, if a trunk has open hold access, but this
                            ; station is set to private hold, then the private hold will be in
                            ; effect.

                            ;               it.  This is the default.

                            ; trunk on a station, the setting for the specific trunk will take priority.
