; func_odbc.conf
;
; Each context is a separately defined function.  By convention, all
; functions are entirely uppercase, so the defined contexts should also
; be all-uppercase, but there is nothing that enforces this.  All functions
; are case-sensitive, however.
;
; For substitution, you have ${ARG1}, ${ARG2} ... ${ARGn}
; for the arguments to each SQL statement.
;
; In addition, for write statements, you have ${VAL1}, ${VAL2} ... ${VALn}
; parsed, just like arguments, for the values.  In addition, if you want the
; whole value, never mind the parsing, you can get that with ${VALUE}.
;
;
; If you have data which may potentially contain single ticks, you may wish
; to use the dialplan function SQL_ESC() to escape the data prior to its
; inclusion in the SQL statement.
;
;
; The following options are available in this configuration file:
;
; readhandle   A comma-separated list of DSNs (from res_odbc.conf) to use when
;              executing the readsql statement.  Each DSN is tried, in
;              succession, until the statement succeeds.  You may specify up to
;              5 DSNs per function class.  If not specified, it will default to
;              the value of writehandle or dsn, if specified.
; writehandle  A comma-separated list of DSNs (from res_odbc.conf) to use when
;              executing the writesql statement.  The same rules apply as to
;              readhandle.  "dsn" is a synonym for "writehandle".
; readsql      The statement to execute when reading from the function class.
; writesql     The statement to execute when writing to the function class.
; insertsql    The statement to execute when writing to the function class
;              succeeds, but initially indicates that 0 rows were affected.
; prefix       Normally, all function classes are prefixed with "ODBC" to keep
;              them uniquely named.  You may choose to change this prefix, which
;              may be useful to segregate a collection of certain function
;              classes from others.
; escapecommas This option may be used to turn off the default behavior of
;              escaping commas which occur within a field.  If commas are
;              escaped (the default behavior), then fields containing commas
;              will be treated as a single value when assigning to ARRAY() or
;              HASH().  If commas are not escaped, then values will be separated
;              at the comma within fields.  Please note that turning this option
;              off is incompatible with the functionality of HASH().
; synopsis     Appears in the synopsis field for the command
;              'core show function <function name>'
; mode         This option may be set to 'multirow' to allow the function
;              specified to return more than a single row.  However, this
;              changes the way that func_odbc normally works.  Instead of the
;              invocation of the function returning a row, it returns an opaque
;              ID, which may be passed to ODBC_FETCH() to return each row in
;              turn.  ODBC_FETCH_STATUS returns SUCCESS or FAILURE, to indicate
;              whether any results were stored, and you should call ODBC_Finish
;              on the ID to clean up any remaining results when you are done
;              with the query.  Also, the variable ODBCROWS is set initially,
;              which may be used in an iterative fashion to return each row in
;              the result.
;              Please note that multirow queries are isolated to the channel,
;              and rows may not be fetched outside of the channel where the
;              query was initially performed.  Additionally, as the results are
;              associated with a channel, mode=multirow is incompatible with
;              the global space.
; rowlimit     Rowlimit limits the total number of rows which can be stored for
;              that query.  For mode=multirow, otherwise, func_odbc will
;              attempt to store all rows in the resultset, up to the maximum
;              amount of memory.  In normal mode, rowlimit can be set to allow
;              additional rows to be fetched, rather than just the first one.
;              These additional rows can be returned by using the name of the
;              function which was called to retrieve the first row as an
;              argument to ODBC_FETCH().
