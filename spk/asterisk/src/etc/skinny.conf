;authtimeout = 30       ; authtimeout specifies the maximum number of seconds a
			; client has to authenticate.  If the client does not
			; authenticate beofre this timeout expires, the client
                        ; will be disconnected.  (default: 30 seconds)

;authlimit = 50         ; authlimit specifies the maximum number of
			; unauthenticated sessions that will be allowed to
                        ; connect at any given time. (default: 50)

; If regcontext is specified, Asterisk will dynamically create and destroy a
; NoOp priority 1 extension for a given line which registers or unregisters with
; us and have a "regexten=" configuration item.
; Multiple contexts may be specified by separating them with '&'. The
; actual extension is the 'regexten' parameter of the registering line or its
; name if 'regexten' is not provided.  If more than one context is provided,
; the context must be specified within regexten by appending the desired
; context after '@'.  More than one regexten may be supplied if they are
; separated by '&'.  Patterns may be used in regexten.

;------------------------------ JITTER BUFFER CONFIGURATION --------------------------

                             ; skinny channel. Defaults to "no". An enabled jitterbuffer will
                             ; be used only if the sending side can create and the receiving
                             ; side can not accept jitter. The skinny channel can accept
                             ; jitter, thus a jitterbuffer on the receive skinny side will be
                             ; used only if it is forced and enabled.

;jbforce = no                ; Forces the use of a jitterbuffer on the receive side of a skinny
                             ; channel. Defaults to "no".

;jbmaxsize = 200             ; Max length of the jitterbuffer in milliseconds.

;jbresyncthreshold = 1000    ; Jump in the frame timestamps over which the jitterbuffer is
                             ; resynchronized. Useful to improve the quality of the voice, with
                             ; big jumps in/broken timestamps, usually sent from exotic devices
                             ; and programs. Defaults to 1000.

;jbimpl = fixed              ; Jitterbuffer implementation, used on the receiving side of a
                             ; skinny channel. Two implementations are currently available
                             ; - "fixed" (with size always equals to jbmaxsize)
                             ; - "adaptive" (with variable size, actually the new jb of IAX2).
                             ; Defaults to fixed.

;jblog = no                  ; Enables jitterbuffer frame logging. Defaults to "no".

[lines]
;----------------------------------- LINES SECTION --------------------------------
; Options set under [lines] apply to all lines unless explicitly set for a particular
; device. The options that can be set under lines are specified in GENERAL LINE OPTIONS.
; These options can also be set for each individual device as well as those under SPECIFIC
; LINE OPTIONS.
;
; Each label below [lines] in [] is a new line with the specific options specified below
; it. Config stops reading new lines when one of the following is found: [general], [devices]
; or the end of skinny.conf.
;
; Where options are common to both lines and devices, the results typically take that of
; the least permission. ie if a no is set for either line or device, the call will not be
; able to use that permission
