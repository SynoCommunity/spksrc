# Enable disk cache. If SIZE is 0, the disk cache is disabled.
# This feature caches the downloaded data in memory, which grows
# to at most SIZE bytes. The cache storage is created for aria2
# instance and shared by all downloads. The one advantage of the
# disk cache is reduce the disk I/O because the data are written
# in larger unit and it is reordered by the offset of the file.
# If hash checking is involved and the data are cached in memory,
# we don’t need to read them from the disk. SIZE can include
# K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). Default: 16M

# Specify file allocation method. none doesn’t pre-allocate file space.
# prealloc pre-allocates file space before download begins. This may
# take some time depending on the size of the file. If you are using
# newer file systems such as ext4 (with extents support), btrfs,
# xfs or NTFS(MinGW build only), falloc is your best choice.
# It allocates large(few GiB) files almost instantly.
# Don’t use falloc with legacy file systems such as ext3 and FAT32
# because it takes almost same time as prealloc and it blocks aria2
# entirely until allocation finishes. falloc may not be available
# if your system doesn’t have posix_fallocate(3) function. trunc uses
# ftruncate(2) system call or platform-specific counterpart to
# truncate a file to a specified length.
# Possible Values: none, prealloc, trunc, falloc Default: prealloc

# sources(if --split >= 2, of course). If SIZE is 15M, since 2*15M > 20MiB,
# aria2 does not split file and download it using 1 source.
