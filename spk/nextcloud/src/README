This SynoCommunity package downloads the corresponding Nextcloud release from
upstream during installation or upgrade.

During installation the service scripts fetch the official archive into the
package temporary directory and extract it into
/var/services/web_packages/nextcloud. The downloaded tarball is cached in
@tmp to support future reinstalls while keeping the published SPK small.
