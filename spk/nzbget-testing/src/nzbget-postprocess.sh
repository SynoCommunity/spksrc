#######################    Usage instructions     #######################
# o  Script will cleanup, join ts-files and rename img-files to iso.
#
# o  To use this script with nzbget set the option "PostProcess" in
#    nzbget configuration file to point to this script file. E.g.:
#        PostProcess=/home/user/nzbget/nzbget-postprocess.sh
#
# o  The script needs a configuration file. An example configuration file
#    is provided in file "nzbget-postprocess.conf". Put the configuration file 
#    into the directory where nzbget's configuration file (nzbget.conf) is located.
#    Then edit the configuration file in any text editor to adjust the settings.
#
# o  You can also edit the script's configuration via web-interface.
#
# o  There are few options, which can be ajdusted for each nzb-file individually.

# NZBGet passes following arguments to postprocess-programm as environment
# variables:
#  NZBPP_DIRECTORY    - path to destination dir for downloaded files;
#  NZBPP_NZBNAME      - user-friendly name of processed nzb-file as it is displayed
#                       by the program. The file path and extension are removed.
#                       If download was renamed, this parameter reflects the new name;
#  NZBPP_NZBFILENAME  - name of processed nzb-file. It includes file extension and also
#                       may include full path;
#  NZBPP_CATEGORY     - category assigned to nzb-file (can be empty string);
#  NZBPP_PARSTATUS    - result of par-check:
#                       0 = not checked: par-check is disabled or nzb-file does
#                           not contain any par-files;
#                       1 = checked and failed to repair;
#                       2 = checked and successfully repaired;
#                       3 = checked and can be repaired but repair is disabled.
#  NZBPP_UNPACKSTATUS - result of unpack:
#                       0 = unpack is disabled or was skipped due to nzb-file
#                           properties or due to errors during par-check;
#                       1 = unpack failed;
#                       2 = unpack successful.
