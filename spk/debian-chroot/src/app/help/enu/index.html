        <h1>Debian Chroot</h1>
        <p><a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> is a free operating system (OS)
            that comes with over 29000 packages, precompiled software bundled up in a
            nice format for easy installation on your DiskStation. Debian Chroot allows
            you to benefit from the Debian OS inside your DiskStation, alongside DSM.
            This package is intended for advanced users only.</p>
        <h3>Installation</h3>
        <p>Once the installation finished in the Package Center, it continues in the
            background and you can see its status to <b>Installing</b> under
            <b>Overview</b> in the left pane. The installation finished, the status
            will automatically change to <b>Installed</b>.</p>
        <p>In the same pane, you can monitor how many services are running and perform
            update operations.</p>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>As soon as the status is <b>Installed</b>, you can start using the chroot.
            To do so, connect to the DiskStation through SSH (root user) and use the following command:
            <b>/var/packages/debian-chroot/scripts/start-stop-status chroot</b>.</p>
        <p>On the first use, it is recommended to perform some configuration operations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Update: type <b>aptitude update</b> followed by <b>aptitude upgrade</b></li>
            <li>Locales: type <b>aptitude install locales</b> and then <b>dpkg-reconfigure locales</b></li>
            <li>Timezone: execute <b>dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</b></li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a href="services.html">Configure services</a></h4>
        <p>Debian Chroot allows you to manage the packages you installed in the chroot directly
        from DSM.</p>
