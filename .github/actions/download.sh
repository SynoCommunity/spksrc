# Part of GitHub build action.
# This script downloads source files for cross and python packages as part of our build process.

# Functions:
# - Download all referenced native and cross source files for packages.
# - Download all referenced python wheels needed to build.
# - The "download" target auto-orchestrates when a package has multiple (arch-specific) files.
# - Retry download if checksum fails (cached file may be outdated).
