# Part of github build action
# 
# build the packages depending on evaluated packages (see prepare.sh)
#
# Functions:
# - Build all packages depending on files defined in ${ARCH_PACKAGES} or ${NOARCH_PACKAGES}.
# - Build for arch defined by ${GH_ARCH} (e.g. x64-6.1, noarch, ...).
# - Successfully built packages are logged to $BUILD_SUCCESS_FILE.
# - Failed builds are logged to ${BUILD_ERROR_FILE} and annotated as error.
# - The build output is structured into log groups by package.
# - As the disk space in the workflow environment is limitted, we clean the
#   work folder of each package after build. At 2020.06 this limit is 14GB.
# - ffmpeg (spk/ffmpeg4), ffmpeg5 and ffmpeg6 are not cleaned to be available for dependents.
# - Therefore ffmpeg4, ffmpeg5 and ffmpeg6 are built first if triggered by its
#   own or a dependent (see prepare.sh).
