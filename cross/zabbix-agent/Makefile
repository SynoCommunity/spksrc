# build instructions:
# https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/installation/install

# Notes on compilation options:
# 
# o Command-line utilities zabbix_get and zabbix_sender are compiled if --enable-agent option is used.
# o --with-libcurl and --with-libxml2 configuration options are required for virtual machine monitoring; 
#   --with-libcurl is also required for SMTP authentication and web.page.* Zabbix agent items. 
#   Note that cURL 7.20.0 or higher is required with the --with-libcurl configuration option.
# o Zabbix always compiles with the PCRE library; installing it is not optional. --with-libpcre=[DIR] only 
#   allows pointing to a specific base install directory, instead of searching through a number of common 
#   places for the libpcre files.
# o You may use the --enable-static flag to statically link libraries. If you plan to distribute compiled 
#   binaries among different servers, you must use this flag to make these binaries work without required 
#   libraries. Note that --enable-static does not work in Solaris.
# o Using --enable-static option is not recommended when building server. In order to build the server 
#   statically, you must have a static version of every external library needed. There is no strict check 
#   for that in configure script.
# o Add optional path to the MySQL configuration file --with-mysql=/<path_to_the_file>/mysql_config to select 
#   the desired MySQL client library when there is a need to use one that is not located in the default location. 
#   It is useful when there are several versions of MySQL installed or MariaDB installed alongside MySQL on the 
#   same system.
