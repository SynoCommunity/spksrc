# This file is a shell script that caches the results of configure
# tests run on this system so they can be shared between configure
# scripts and configure runs, see configure's option --config-cache.
# It is not useful on other systems.  If it contains results you don't
# want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
#
# config.status only pays attention to the cache file if you give it
# the --recheck option to rerun configure.
#
# `ac_cv_env_foo' variables (set or unset) will be overridden when
