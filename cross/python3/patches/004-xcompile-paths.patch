When compiling x86/x64 toolchains the setup.py script will
automatically try to add library-dirs of the compile host.
This results in failures to compile modules on those platforms.
This first block is copied from
cross/python/patches/002-no-system-multiarch.patch

The second block allows custom -I and -L to survive into the cross environment.
