# REMARKGS:
# currently stay on version 4.8
# version 4.9 fails with the error for all DSM 6 (even 64 bit):
# error "<fts.h> cannot be used with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS==64"
# we will have to decide whether we 
# - fall back to version 4.0 for all packages with DSM < 7
# - keep nnn version 4.8 for DSM 6 and x64, x86 and aarch64
# - patch version > 4.8 for DSM 6 and x64, x86 and aarch64 to remove the definition of _FILE_OFFSET_BITS==64
#   (but we have to verify that 64 bit/largefile support is working when built without -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS==64)
