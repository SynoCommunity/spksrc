# REMARKS:
# nnn version 4.0 is the latest version for 32-bit archs on DSM 6 and for comcerto2k
# nnn version 4.8 is the latest version for 64-bit archs on DSM 6
# later versions fail with the following error for all DSM 6 (even 64 bit):
# error "<fts.h> cannot be used with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS==64"

# All DSM 6 toolchains (and DSM 7 of comcerto2k) have identical fts.h file (usr/inluce/fts.h) with this guard:
#  /* The fts interface is incompatible with the LFS interface which
#     transparently uses the 64-bit file access functions.  */
#  #ifdef __USE_FILE_OFFSET64
#  # error "<fts.h> cannot be used with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS==64"
