Setup Development Environment
-----------------------------
Docker
^^^^^^
* Fork and clone spksrc: ``git clone https://You@github.com/You/spksrc.git ~/spksrc``
* Install Docker on your host OS: `Docker installation`_. A wget-based alternative for linux: `Install Docker with wget`_.
* Download the spksrc docker container: ``docker pull synocommunity/spksrc``
* Run the container with ``docker run -it -v ~/spksrc:/spksrc synocommunity/spksrc /bin/bash``


Virtual machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A virtual machine based on an 64-bit version of Debian stable OS is recommended. Non-x86 architectures are not supported.

* Install the requirements::

    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt-get update
    sudo aptitude install build-essential debootstrap python-pip automake libgmp3-dev libltdl-dev libunistring-dev libffi-dev libcppunit-dev ncurses-dev imagemagick libssl-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev gettext git curl subversion check intltool gperf flex bison xmlto php5 expect libgc-dev mercurial cython lzip cmake swig libc6-i386 libmount-dev libpcre3-dev libbz2-dev
    sudo pip install -U setuptools pip wheel httpie

* You may need to install some packages from testing like autoconf. Read about Apt-Pinning to know how to do that.
* Some older toolchains may require 32-bit development versions of packages, e.g. `zlib1g-dev:i386`


Usage
-----
Once you have a development environment set up, you can start building packages, create new ones, or improve upon existing packages while making your changes available to other people.
