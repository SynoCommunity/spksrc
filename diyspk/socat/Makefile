DESCRIPTION = socat - Multipurpose relay \(SOcket CAT)\. Socat is a command line based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte streams and transfers data between them. Because the streams can be constructed from a large set of different types of data sinks and sources, and because lots of address options may be applied to the streams, socat can be used for many different purposes.
