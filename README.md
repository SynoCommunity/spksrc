SPKSRC
=====

*SPKSRC is currently in alpha stage. All dependencies do not work correctly.*

SPKSRC is a cross compilation framework intended to compile sfotware for the Synology's NAS.

## Usage
To build an spk, cd to the corresponding folder in spk/, and type make ARCH=<your arch>. The list of supported architecture is found in toolchains/ (note that the syno- prefix shall not be added). 

Files will be downloaded in distrib, and packages will placed in packages.

## Todo
* Add more software
* Do some more clean up in mk/
* Add generic support for DSM integration
* Add support for custom package server upload 
* Add support for download validation (check hash on downloaded files)
