# spksrc
spksrc is a cross compilation framework intended to compile and package software for Synology NAS devices. Packages are made available via the [SynoCommunity repository].


# DSM 7
DSM 7 was released on June 29 2021 as Version 7.0.41890.

* The main issue we had with our reposity is fixed in [spkrepo](https://github.com/SynoCommunity/spkrepo/pull/112) and online since February 2024
  - before the repository deliverd DSM 6 packages for Systems with DSM 7, when no DSM 7 package was available
  - this gave errors like "invalid file format" (or "package requires root privileges")
  - you still get this error when manually installing a DSM 6 package on DSM 7
* You find the status of the former packages in the issue [#4524] **Meta: DSM7 package status**
* New packages support DSM 7 from initial package version (and some require at least DSM 7).
* **ATTENTION**: As reported, package configuration settings may be lost following the upgrade to DSM 7 and the execution of a Package repair. Make sure to backup your settings and configuration for your SynoCommunity packages before installation of DSM 7 to facilitate restoration if needed.


## Contributing
Before opening a new issue, check the [FAQ] and search open issues.
If you can't find an answer, or if you want to open a package request, read [CONTRIBUTING] to make sure you include all the information needed for contributors to handle your request.


## Setup Development Environment
### Docker
*The Docker development environment supports Linux and macOS systems, but not Windows due to limitations of the underlying file system.*

1. [Fork and clone] spksrc: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/spksrc`
2. Install Docker on your host OS (see [Docker installation], or use a `wget`-based alternative for linux [Install Docker with wget]).
3. Download the spksrc Docker container: `docker pull ghcr.io/synocommunity/spksrc`
4. Run the container with the repository mounted into the `/spksrc` directory with the appropriate command for your host Operating System:

```bash
cd spksrc # Go to the cloned repository's root folder.

# If running on Linux:
docker run -it --platform=linux/amd64 -v $(pwd):/spksrc -w /spksrc ghcr.io/synocommunity/spksrc /bin/bash

# If running on macOS:
docker run -it --platform=linux/amd64 -v $(pwd):/spksrc -w /spksrc -e TAR_CMD="fakeroot tar" ghcr.io/synocommunity/spksrc /bin/bash
```
5. From there, follow the instructions in the [Developers HOW TO].



### Virtual machine
A virtual machine based on an 64-bit version of Debian 11 stable OS is recommended. Non-x86 architectures are not supported.

Install the requirements (in sync with `Dockerfile`):
```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt-get update
sudo apt update
sudo apt install autoconf-archive autogen automake autopoint bash bc bison \
                 build-essential check cmake curl cython3 debootstrap ed expect fakeroot flex \
                 g++-multilib gawk gettext git gperf imagemagick intltool jq libbz2-dev libc6-i386 \
                 libcppunit-dev libffi-dev libgc-dev libgmp3-dev libltdl-dev libmount-dev libncurses-dev \
                 libpcre3-dev libssl-dev libtool libunistring-dev lzip mercurial moreutils ninja-build \
                 patchelf php pkg-config python2 python3 python3-distutils rename ruby-mustache rsync scons subversion \
                 swig texinfo unzip xmlto zip zlib1g-dev
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py -O - | sudo python2
sudo pip2 install wheel httpie
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -O - | sudo python3
sudo pip3 install meson==1.0.0
```
From there, follow the instructions in the [Developers HOW TO].

* You may need to install some packages from testing like autoconf. Read about Apt-Pinning to know how to do that.
* Some older toolchains may require 32-bit development versions of packages, e.g. `zlib1g-dev:i386`



### LXC
A container based on 64-bit version of Debian 11 stable OS is recommended. Non-x86 architectures are not supported.  The following assumes your LXD/LXC environment is already initiated (e.g. `lxc init`) and you have minimal LXD/LXC basic knowledge :
1. Create a new container (will use x86_64/amd64 arch by default): `lxc launch images:debian/11 spksrc`
2. Enable i386 arch: `lxc exec spksrc -- /usr/bin/dpkg --add-architecture i386`
3. Update apt channels: `lxc exec spksrc -- /usr/bin/apt update`
4. Install all required packages:
```bash
lxc exec spksrc -- /usr/bin/apt install autoconf-archive autogen automake autopoint bash bc bison \
                                build-essential check cmake curl cython3 debootstrap ed expect fakeroot flex \
                                g++-multilib gawk gettext git gperf imagemagick intltool jq libbz2-dev libc6-i386 \
                                libcppunit-dev libffi-dev libgc-dev libgmp3-dev libltdl-dev libmount-dev libncurses-dev \
                                libpcre3-dev libssl-dev libtool libunistring-dev lzip mercurial moreutils ninja-build \
                                patchelf php pkg-config python2 python3 python3-distutils rename rsync ruby-mustache scons subversion \
                                swig texinfo unzip xmlto zip zlib1g-dev
```
5. Install `python2` wheels:
```bash
lxc exec spksrc -- /bin/bash -c "wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py -O - | python2"
lxc exec spksrc -- /bin/bash -c "pip2 install virtualenv httpie"
```
6. Install `python3` `pip`:
```bash
lxc exec spksrc -- /bin/bash -c "wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -O - | python3"
```
7. Install `meson`:
```bash
lxc exec spksrc -- /bin/bash -c "pip3 install meson==1.0.0"
```


#### LXC: `spksrc` user
8. By default it is assumed that you will be running as `spksrc` user into the LXC container.  Such user needs to be created into the default container image:
```bash
lxc exec spksrc -- /usr/sbin/adduser --uid 1001 spksrc
```
9. Setup a default shell environment:
```bash
lxc exec spksrc --user 1001 -- cp /etc/skel/.profile /etc/skel/.bashrc ~spksrc/.
```

From there you can connect to your container as `spksrc` and follow the instructions in the [Developers HOW TO].
```bash
lxc exec spksrc -- su --login spksrc
spksrc@spksrc:~$
```

#### (OPTIONAL) Install misc base tools:
```bash
lxc exec spksrc -- /usr/bin/apt install bash-completion man-db manpages-dev \
                                        mlocate ripgrep rsync tree time
lxc exec spksrc -- /usr/bin/updatedb
```
Install github client:
```
$ lxc exec spksrc -- su --login root
# curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
# echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install gh
# exit
```

#### (OPTIONAL) LXC: Shared `spksrc` user
You can create a shared user between your Debian/Ubuntu host and the LXC Debian container which simplifies greatly file management between the two.  The following assumes you already created a user `spksrc` with uid 1001 in your Debian/Ubuntu host environment and that you which to share its `/home` userspace.
1. Create a mapping rule between the hosts and the LXC image:
```bash
lxc config set spksrc raw.idmap "both 1001 1001"
lxc restart spksrc
Remapping container filesystem
```
2. Add `/home/spksrc` from the hsot to the LXC container:
```bash
lxc config device add spksrc home disk path=/home/spksrc source=/home/spksrc
Device home added to spksrc
```
3. Connect as `spksrc` user:
```bash
lxc exec spksrc -- su --login spksrc
spksrc@spksrc:~$
```

#### LXC: Proxy (OPTIONAL)
The following assume you have a running proxy on your LAN setup at IP 192.168.1.1 listening on port 3128 that will allow caching files.
1. Enforce using a proxy:
```bash
lxc config set spksrc environment.http_proxy http://192.168.1.1:3128
lxc config set spksrc environment.https_proxy http://192.168.1.1:3128
```
2. Enforce using a proxy with `wget` in the spksrc container user account:
```bash
lxc exec spksrc --user $(id -u spksrc) -- bash -c "cat << EOF > ~spksrc/.wgetrc
use_proxy = on
http_proxy = http://192.168.1.1:3128/
https_proxy = http://192.168.1.1:3128/
ftp_proxy = http://192.168.1.1:3128/
EOF"
```


## Usage
Once you have a development environment set up, you can start building packages, create new ones, or improve upon existing packages while making your changes available to other people.
See the [Developers HOW TO] for information on how to use spksrc.
